<html><h1>Chimes of Freedom</h1><body><p><div>Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,</div><div>We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,</div><div>As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,</div><div>Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,</div><div>Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,</div><div>Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight</div><div>And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,</div><div>And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.</div></p><p><div>Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched</div><div>With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,</div><div>As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,</div><div>Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,</div><div>Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,</div><div>Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,</div><div>Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,</div><div>And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.</div></p><p><div>Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,</div><div>The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,</div><div>That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,</div><div>Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,</div><div>Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,</div><div>Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,</div><div>And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,</div><div>And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.</div></p><p><div>In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales</div><div>For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,</div><div>Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,</div><div>All down in taken-for-granted situations,</div><div>Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,</div><div>For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,</div><div>For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,</div><div>And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.</div></p><p><div>Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared</div><div>And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,</div><div>Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones</div><div>Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,</div><div>Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,</div><div>For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,</div><div>And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,</div><div>And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.</div></p><p><div>Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,</div><div>Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,</div><div>As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,</div><div>Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,</div><div>Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,</div><div>For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,</div><div>And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,</div><div>And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.</div></p></body></html>
