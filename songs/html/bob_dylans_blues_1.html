    Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
   </div>

    Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.

   <div>
    Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.

   </div>
   <div>
    With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.

    Watch out so you don't step on me!
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
