However, what's actually sung by Dylan and Emmylou Harris does not sound that much like the word "then". Whatever is sung seems to start with <i>l</i> and end with a fricative (<i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>th</i>, etc.), or at least have a fricative near the end, which leads me to believe that it might actually be the word "left". If "then" is incorrect, "left" makes the most sense since it fits the phonetic description and makes sense semantically and syntactically. However, I have chosen to stick with "then" only because in the versions of "Oh, Sister" from <i>Hard Rain</i> and <i>At Budokan</i>, "then" is sung pretty clearly.</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/desire.html">Back</a></li></ul></body></html>
