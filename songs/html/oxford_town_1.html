    He went down to Oxford Town.
   </div>
   <div>
    Guns and clubs followed him down
   </div>
   <div>
    All because his face was brown.
   </div>
   <div>
    Better get away from Oxford Town.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Oxford Town around the bend,
   </div>
   <div>
    Come to the door, he couldn't get in
   </div>
   <div>
    All because of the color of his skin.
   </div>
