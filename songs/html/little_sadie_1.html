I think Dylan makes a grammatical mistake here (and by "mistake" I never mean an instance of non-standard English, but rather an actual grammatical mistake, an instance where one says something that one did not intend to say) or Dylan simply says "I".</small></div><div><a name="3"><sup>3</sup></a><small>	Dylan probably just gets tripped up here, thinking of saying "Remember the night you laid little Sadie down" or something similar.</small></div></p></body></html>
