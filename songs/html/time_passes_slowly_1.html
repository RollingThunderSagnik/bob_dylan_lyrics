If one listens closely, however, "we" is not to be heard, which then begs the question of who/what the subject of the verbs in this line is. Although the verbs <i>stare</i> and <i>try</i> usually presume a sentient subject, I believe that the subject here might simply be "time".</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="javascript:history.back()">Back</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
