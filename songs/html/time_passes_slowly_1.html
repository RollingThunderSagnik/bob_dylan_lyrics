If one listens closely, however, "we" is not to be heard, which then begs the question of who/what the subject of the verbs in this line is. Although the verbs <i>stare</i> and <i>try</i> usually presume a sentient subject, I believe that the subject here might simply be "time".</small></div></p></body></html>
