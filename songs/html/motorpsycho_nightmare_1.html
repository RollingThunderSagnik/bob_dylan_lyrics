I had come a long, long way.</div><div>I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"</div><div>I was standing on the steps feeling most alone</div><div>When out comes a farmer â€“ he musta thought that I was nuts.</div><div>He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.</div></p><p><div>I fell down to my bended knees,</div><div>Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"</div><div>He cocked his rifle and began to shout,</div><div>"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"</div><div>I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.</div><div>I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."</div></p><p><div>Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.</div><div>She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.</div><div>I immediately tried to cool it with her dad</div><div>And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.</div><div>He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"</div><div>I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."</div></p><p><div>Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.</div><div>He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.</div><div>I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."</div><div>He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.</div><div>Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:</div><div>That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."</div></p><p><div>I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.</div><div>There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.</div><div>She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."</div><div>I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"</div><div>I knew I had to split, but I did not know how</div><div>When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"</div></p><p><div>Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out</div><div>'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.</div><div>I had to say something to strike him very weird</div><div>So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"</div><div>Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way</div><div>As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"</div></p><p><div>I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."</div><div>And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.</div><div>Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.</div><div>As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill</div><div>Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,</div><div>"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"</div></p><p><div>Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.</div><div>I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun</div><div>And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour</div><div>And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.</div><div>Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.</div><div>The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.</div></p><p><div>Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell</div><div>Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.</div><div>He still waits for me, constant on the sly.</div><div>He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.</div><div>Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.</div><div>Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.</div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/another_side_of_bob_dylan.html">Back</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
