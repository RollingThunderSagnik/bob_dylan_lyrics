    “Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm sailing away in the morning.
   </div>
   <div>
    Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
   </div>
   <div>
    From the place that I'll be landing?”
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    “No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
   </div>
   <div>
    There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
   </div>
   <div>
    Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
   </div>
   <div>
    From across that lonesome ocean.”
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    “Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
   </div>
   <div>
    Made of silver or of golden,
   </div>
   <div>
    Either from the mountains of Madrid
   </div>
   <div>
    Or from the coast of Barcelona.”
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    “Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
   </div>
   <div>
    And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
   </div>
   <div>
    I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
   </div>
   <div>
    For that's all I'm wishing to be owning.”
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    “That I might be gone a long, old time
   </div>
   <div>
    And it's only that I'm asking,
   </div>
   <div>
    Is there something I can send you to remember me by
   </div>
   <div>
    To make your time more easy-passing?”
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    “Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
   </div>
   <div>
    It only brings me sorrow.
   </div>
   <div>
    The same thing I would want today
   </div>
   <div>
    I would want again tomorrow.”
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
   </div>
   <div>
    It was from her ship sailing,
   </div>
   <div>
    Saying, “I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
   </div>
   <div>
    It depends on how I'm feeling.”
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    “If you, my love, must think that way,
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm sure your mind is roaming,
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
   </div>
   <div>
    But with the country to where you're going.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    “So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
   </div>
   <div>
    Take heed of the stormy weather.
   </div>
   <div>
    And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
   </div>
   <div>
    Spanish boots of Spanish leather.”
