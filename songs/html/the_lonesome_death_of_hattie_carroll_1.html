 <h1>
  The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll
 </h1>
 <body>
  <p>
   <div>
    William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
   </div>
   <div>
    With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
   </div>
   <div>
    At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
   </div>
   <div>
    And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
   </div>
   <div>
    As they rode him in custody down to the station
   </div>
   <div>
    And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
   </div>
   <div>
    But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
   </div>
   <div>
    Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
   </div>
   <div>
    Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
   </div>
   <div>
    With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
   </div>
   <div>
    And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
   </div>
   <div>
    Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
   </div>
   <div>
    And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
   </div>
   <div>
    And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
   </div>
   <div>
    But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
   </div>
   <div>
    Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
   </div>
   <div>
    She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
   </div>
   <div>
    Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
   </div>
   <div>
    And never sat once at the head of the table
   </div>
   <div>
    And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
   </div>
   <div>
    Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
   </div>
   <div>
    And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
   </div>
   <div>
    Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
   </div>
   <div>
    That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
   </div>
   <div>
    Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
   </div>
   <div>
    And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
   </div>
   <div>
    And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
   </div>
   <div>
    Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
   </div>
   <div>
    To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
   </div>
   <div>
    And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
   </div>
   <div>
    And that even the nobles get properly handled
   </div>
   <div>
    Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
   </div>
   <div>
    And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
   </div>
   <div>
    Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
   </div>
   <div>
    Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
   </div>
   <div>
    And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
   </div>
   <div>
    And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
   </div>
   <div>
    William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
   </div>
   <div>
    Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
   </div>
   <div>
    Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
