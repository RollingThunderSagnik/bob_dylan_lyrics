The line from the original album version is: "Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks".</small></div><div><a name="2"><sup>2</sup></a><small>	After the music has come to a stop following this line and just before Dylan sings the last line, he seems to say something like "a'ight" (contraction of alright) or possibly "what" in such a way that it's not directly spoken/sung into the microphone, which makes me think that it might have been part of an exchange with someone onstage or in the crowd, especially since it comes between the lines and at a stop in the music.</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/hard_rain.html">Back</a></li></ul></body></html>
