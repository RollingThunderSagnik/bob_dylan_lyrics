starred Gregory Peck.</div><div>He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.</div><div>The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.</div></p><p><div>Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp</div><div>As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.</div><div>"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.</div><div>I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."</div></p><p><div>Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in</div><div>And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.</div><div>You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,</div><div>The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.</div></p><p><div>I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert</div><div>In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.</div><div>I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –</div><div>Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.</div></p><p><div>Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'</div><div>And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.</div><div>Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.</div><div>I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.</div></p><p><div>Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –</div><div>Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,</div><div>But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore</div><div>To remember the times when I was your only man</div><div>And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.</div></p><p><div>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,</div><div>Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,</div><div>Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,</div><div>Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.</div></p><p><div>Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.</div><div>We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –</div><div>He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.</div><div>Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,</div><div>She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.</div><div>She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."</div></p><p><div>Then she told us how times were tough</div><div>And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,</div><div>But she changed the subject every time money came up.</div><div>She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",</div><div>But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,</div><div>She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."</div></p><p><div>"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.</div><div>"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,</div><div>Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."</div><div>Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."</div></p><p><div>Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –</div><div>But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.</div><div>All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved</div><div>And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.</div></p><p><div>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,</div><div>Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,</div><div>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,</div><div>Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.</div></p><p><div>Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,</div><div>I was crossing the street when shots rang out.</div><div>I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.</div><div>"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.</div></p><p><div>Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,</div><div>Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".</div><div>You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.</div><div>Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,</div><div>It was the best acting I saw anybody do.</div></p><p><div>Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,</div><div>But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.</div><div>Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,</div><div>You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.</div><div>I could feel a whole lot better</div><div>If you were just here by my side to show me how.</div></p><p><div>Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,</div><div>Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.</div><div>He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,</div><div>But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.</div></p><p><div>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,</div><div>Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,</div><div>Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,</div><div>Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.</div></p><p><div>You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.</div><div>The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter</div><div>Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.</div><div>And, you know, there was something about you, baby,</div><div>That I liked, that was always too good for this world.</div><div>Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked</div><div>That I left in the French Quarter.</div></p><p><div>Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections</div><div>Than people who are most content.</div><div>I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.</div><div>You always said people don't do what they believe in,</div><div>They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.</div><div>And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."</div></p><p><div>There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,</div><div>I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,</div><div>All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,</div><div>He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.</div><div>Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.</div></p><p><div>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,</div><div>Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,</div><div>Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,</div><div>Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.</div></p></div></div></div></body></html>
