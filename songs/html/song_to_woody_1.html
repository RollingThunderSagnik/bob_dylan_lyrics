  Song to Woody

   <div>
    I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
   </div>
   <div>
    Walking a road other men have gone down.
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm seeing your world of people and things,
   </div>
   <div>
    Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
   </div>
   <div>
    'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
   </div>
   <div>
    Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
   </div>
   <div>
    It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
   </div>
   <div>
    All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
   </div>
   <div>
    'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
   </div>
   <div>
    And to all the good people that traveled with you.
   </div>
   <div>
    Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
   </div>
   <div>
    That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
   </div>
   <div>
    Somewhere down the road some day,
   </div>
   <div>
    The very last thing that I'd want to do
   </div>
   <div>
    Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
   </div>
