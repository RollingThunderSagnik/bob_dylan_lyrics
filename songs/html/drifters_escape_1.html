<html><h1>Drifter's Escape</h1><body><p><div>"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say</div><div>As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.</div><div>"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.</div><div>And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."</div></p><p><div>Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.</div><div>"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"</div><div>Outside the crowd was stirring â€“ you could hear it from the door;</div><div>Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.</div></p><p><div>"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.</div><div>"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."</div><div>Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape</div><div>And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.</div></p></body></html>
