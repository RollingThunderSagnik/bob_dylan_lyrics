But, then again, these lyrics are so different from the original album version and other versions of the song that I can't be sure that Dylan is even stumbling. The lyrics just seem to be full of odd phrases, wordings that have some quality that is slightly off, i.e., "...when you're walking on the path", "...when you're riding in your seat", "...I wouldn't feel too all alone...", etc.</small></div></p></body></html>
