<html><h1>Fourth Time Around</h1><body><p><div>When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf,</div><div>As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"</div><div>It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,</div><div>Everybody must give something back for something they get."</div></p><p><div>I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.</div><div>And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"</div><div>So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs</div><div>And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.</div></p><p><div>She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.</div><div>And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.</div><div>I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense</div><div>Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –</div></p><p><div>Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.</div><div>She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."</div><div>She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor.</div><div>And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.</div></p><p><div>And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.</div><div>And you–you took me in. You loved me then. You never wasted time.</div><div>And I–I never took much. I never asked for your crutch. Now don't ask for mine.</div></p></body></html>
