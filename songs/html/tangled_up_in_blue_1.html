class="col-md-12"><p><div>Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,</div><div>Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.</div><div>Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,</div><div>They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.</div><div>And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,</div><div>Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,</div><div>Tangled up in blue.</div></p><p><div>She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,</div><div>I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.</div><div>We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,</div><div>Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.</div><div>She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,</div><div>I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,</div><div>Tangled up in blue."</div></p><p><div>I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,</div><div>But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,</div><div>So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,</div><div>Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;</div><div>But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,</div><div>I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew</div><div>Tangled up in blue.</div></p><p><div>She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,</div><div>I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight, so clear,</div><div>And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,</div><div>She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"</div><div>I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,</div><div>I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,</div><div>Tangled up in blue.</div></p><p><div>She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.</div><div>"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."</div><div>Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,</div><div>Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>,</div><div>And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,</div><div>Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,</div><div>Tangled up in blue.</div></p><p><div>I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,</div><div>There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,</div><div>Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,</div><div>She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,</div><div>And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,</div><div>The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,</div><div>Tangled up in blue.</div></p><p><div>So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,</div><div>All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now –</div><div>Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,</div><div>Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,</div><div>But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,</div><div>We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,</div><div>Tangled up in blue.</div></p><p><div><a name="1"><sup>1</sup></a><small>	Other sources transcribe this as "thirteenth
