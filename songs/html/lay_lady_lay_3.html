However, the distinction between the two forms has been increasingly disappearing in English due at least partially to the fact that the base form of the verb <i>lay</i> looks and sounds exactly the same as the simple past form of <i>lay</i>. But just because the use of <i>lay</i> in this song is technically incorrect doesn't mean that it was not intentional: it would not sound right to hear "lie, lady, lie, lie across my big brass bed" (because of the assonance) and, besides, this is how real people talk every day and there's nothing wrong with it.</small></div><div><a name="2"><sup>2</sup></a><small>	Here it's almost as though Dylan begins to sing the line from the original album version, "Why wait any longer for the world to begin?", before improvising about halfway through, which might explain why the line sounds sort of meaningless and inane.</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="javascript:history.back()">Back</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
