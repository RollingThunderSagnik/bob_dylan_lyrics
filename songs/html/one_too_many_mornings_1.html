  One Too Many Mornings

   <div>
    Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
   </div>
   <div>
    As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
   </div>
   <div>
    And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
   </div>
   <div>
    Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
   </div>
   <div>
    And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
   </div>
   <div>
    And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign.
   </div>
   <div>
    And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
   </div>
   <div>
    When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
   </div>
   <div>
    You're right from your side, I'm right from mine.
   </div>
   <div>
    We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
   </div>
