They need somewhere to go</div><div>As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.</div></p><p><div>Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles</div><div>And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.</div><div>And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."</div><div>And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend. You'd better leave."</div><div>And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go</div><div>Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.</div></p><p><div>Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide.</div><div>The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.</div><div>All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,</div><div>Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.</div><div>And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.</div><div>He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.</div></p><p><div>Ophelia, she's 'neath the window. For her I feel so afraid.</div><div>On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.</div><div>To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest.</div><div>Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.</div><div>And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,</div><div>She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.</div></p><p><div>Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,</div><div>Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.</div><div>Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette.</div><div>Then, he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.</div><div>You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago</div><div>For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.</div></p><p><div>Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,</div><div>But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.</div><div>Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole</div><div>And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".</div><div>They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow</div><div>If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.</div></p><p><div>Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,</div><div>The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.</div><div>They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured.</div><div>Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.</div><div>And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know!</div><div>Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"</div></p><p><div>At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew</div><div>Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.</div><div>Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine</div><div>Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene</div><div>Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go</div><div>Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.</div></p><p><div>Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn.</div><div>Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"</div><div>And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower</div><div>While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers</div><div>Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow.</div><div>And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.</div></p><p><div>Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.</div><div>When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?</div><div>All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame.</div><div>I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.</div><div>Right now I can't read too good. Don't send me no more letters, no!</div><div>Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.</div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/highway_61_revisited.html">Back</a></li></ul></body></html>
