  Don't Think Twice, It's Alright

    Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
   </div>
   <div>
    If'n you don't know by now.
   </div>
   <div>
    And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
   </div>
   <div>
    It'll never do, somehow.
   </div>
   <div>
    When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
   </div>
   <div>
    Look out your window and I'll be gone.
   </div>
   <div>
    You're the reason I'm traveling on,
   </div>
   <div>
    But don't think twice, it's alright.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
   </div>
   <div>
    The light I never knowed.
   </div>
   <div>
    And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm on the dark side of the road.
   </div>
   <div>
    But I wish there was something you would do or say
   </div>
   <div>
    To try and make me change my mind and stay.
   </div>
   <div>
    But we never did too much talking, anyway.
   </div>
   <div>
    But don't think twice, it's alright.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
   </div>
   <div>
    Like you never done before.
   </div>
   <div>
    And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
   </div>
   <div>
    I can't hear you anymore.
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
   </div>
   <div>
    I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
   </div>
   <div>
    I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
   </div>
   <div>
    But don't think twice, it's alright.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    So long, honey babe.
   </div>
   <div>
    Where I'm bound I can't tell.
   </div>
   <div>
    Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
   </div>
   <div>
    So I'll just say “Fare thee well”.
   </div>
   <div>
    I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
   </div>
   <div>
    You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
   </div>
   <div>
    You just kinda wasted my precious time,
   </div>
   <div>
    But don't think twice, it's alright.
   </div>
