  Girl from the North Country

  <p>
   <div>
    If you're traveling in the north country fair,
   </div>
   <div>
    Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
   </div>
   <div>
    Remember me to the one who lives there
   </div>
   <div>
    For she once was a true love of mine.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    If you go when the snowflakes storm,
   </div>
   <div>
    When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
   </div>
   <div>
    Please see she has a coat so warm,
   </div>
   <div>
    To keep her from the howling winds.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Please see if her hair hangs long,
   </div>
   <div>
    If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
   </div>
   <div>
    Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
   </div>
   <div>
    For that's the way I remember her best.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
   </div>
   <div>
    Many times I've often prayed
   </div>
   <div>
    In the darkness of my night,
   </div>
   <div>
    In the brightness of my day.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
   </div>
   <div>
    Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
   </div>
   <div>
    Remember me to the one who lives there
   </div>
   <div>
    For she once was a true love of mine.
