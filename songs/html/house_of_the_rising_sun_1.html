  House of the Rising Sun

   <div>
    There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
   </div>
   <div>
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
   </div>
   <div>
    My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
   </div>
   <div>
    And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
   </div>
   <div>
    And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
   </div>
   <div>
    But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
   </div>
