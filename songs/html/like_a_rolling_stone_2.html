The words in the middle are somewhat garbled and therefore it's difficult to say what they actually are. Dylan garbles many lines throughout this song and he sings in a very absentminded manner. When there seems to be a sort of discontinuity I generally use a double "–", which at times connects two parts of different lines and at others just sort of indicates a jumble of words that I cannot decipher.</small></div></p></body></html>
