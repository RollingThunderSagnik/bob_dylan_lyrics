According to other lyrics sources (some of which contain lyrics that are wholly rewritten), the line is as follows: "We pointed out the way to go / And scratched your name in sand...". Obviously, this is not a mistake of transcription, but the thing to be noticed is that the syntactic structure in this version is different from the first part of the line in the actual recording: "We pointed out the way to go" vs. "It was all pointed out, the way to go". Yet the second part of the line from the recording follows the structure from this other version of the lyrics perfectly.</small></div><div><a name="2"><sup>2</sup></a><small>	Here seemingly is another example of the situation in the footnote above: it seems that an earlier version of a line's structure is partially retained in a new version of the line, but the meaning of the line is mangled because the structures are not compatible. Other sources transcribe the line as follows: "Now, I want you to know that while we watched / You discover there was no one true...". In the actual recording, "while we watched" becomes "while you watched" (or maybe even "while you were watched", which would be closer to the original meaning), so there's no direct object of <i>watch</i> and therefore the "discover that there was no one true" phrase has no subject.</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/the_basement_tapes.html">Back</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
