  Freight Train Blues

   <div>
    I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
   </div>
   <div>
    Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
   </div>
   <div>
    Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
   </div>
   <div>
    Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
   </div>
   <div>
    I've got the freight train blues!
   </div>
   <div>
    Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
   </div>
   <div>
    It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
   </div>
   <div>
    She was the only daughter of the engineer.
   </div>
   <div>
    My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
   </div>
   <div>
    It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
   </div>
   <div>
    I got the freight train blues!
   </div>
   <div>
    Oh, lawdy, I got ‘em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
   </div>
   <div>
    Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
   </div>
   <div>
    Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
   </div>
   <div>
    Every place I wanna go
   </div>
   <div>
    I never can go because, you know,
   </div>
   <div>
    I got the freight train blues!
   </div>
   <div>
    Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
