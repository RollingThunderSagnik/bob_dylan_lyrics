class="row"><div class="col-xs-12"><p><div>Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,</div><div>Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.</div><div>They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,</div><div>She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –</div><div>I can't help it if I'm lucky.</div></p><p><div>People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,</div><div>Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.</div><div>And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,</div><div>I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,</div><div>Sweet lady.</div></p><p><div>Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,</div><div>Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,</div><div>Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,</div><div>You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.</div></p><p><div>I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> lightning might strike,</div><div>I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.</div><div>There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,</div><div>He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war</div><div>After losing every battle.</div></p><p><div>I woke up on the roadside, daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,</div><div>Visions of your smoking tone2 shoot through my head and are making me see stars.</div><div>You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,</div><div>One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,</div><div>Blood on your saddle.</div></p><p><div>Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,</div><div>Blowing through the curtains in your room,</div><div>Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,</div><div>You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.</div></p><p><div>It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,</div><div>You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.</div><div>Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,</div><div>What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top</div><div>You are on the bottom.</div></p><p><div>I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,</div><div>I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.</div><div>The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,</div><div>I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned</div><div>Slowly into autumn.</div></p><p><div>Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,</div><div>From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,</div><div>Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,</div><div>You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.</div></p><p><div>I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,</div><div>Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.</div><div>Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,</div><div>I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory</div><div>And all your raging glory.</div></p><p><div>I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,</div><div>I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.</div><div>You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above</div><div>And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love</div><div>And it makes me feel so sorry.</div></p><p><div>Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,</div><div>Blowing through the letters that we wrote,</div><div>Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,</div><div>We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.</div></p><p><div><a name="1"><sup>1</sup></a><small>	Sic.</small></div><div><a name="2"><sup>2</sup></a><small>	It is
