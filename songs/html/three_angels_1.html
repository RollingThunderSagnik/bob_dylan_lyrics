<html><h1>Three Angels</h1><body><p><div>Three angels up above the street,</div><div>Each one playing a horn,</div><div>Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,</div><div>They've been there since Christmas morn.</div><div>The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,</div><div>Then a lady in a bright orange dress,</div><div>One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,</div><div>The Tenth Avenue bus going west.</div><div>The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,</div><div>A man with a badge skips by,</div><div>Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,</div><div>Nobody stops to ask why.</div><div>The bakery truck stops outside of that fence</div><div>Where the angels stand high on the poles,</div><div>The driver peeks out, trying to find one face</div><div>In this concrete world full of souls.</div><div>The angels play on their horns all day,</div><div>The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,</div><div>But does anyone hear the music they play?</div><div>Does anyone even try?</div></p></body></html>
