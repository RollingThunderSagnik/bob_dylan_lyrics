<html><h1>Isis</h1><body><p><div>I married Isis on the fifth day of May,</div><div>But I could not hold on to her very long,</div><div>So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away</div><div>For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.</div></p><p><div>I came to a high place of darkness and light,</div><div>Dividing line ran through the center of town,</div><div>I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,</div><div>Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.</div></p><p><div>A man in the corner approached me for a match,</div><div>I knew right away he was not ordinary,</div><div>He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"</div><div>Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."</div></p><p><div>We set out that night for the cold in the North,</div><div>I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,</div><div>I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.</div><div>I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."</div></p><p><div>I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,</div><div>I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,</div><div>As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,</div><div>I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,</div></p><p><div>How she told me that one day we would meet up again</div><div>And things would be different the next time we wed</div><div>If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –</div><div>I still can't remember all the best things she said.</div></p><p><div>We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,</div><div>He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find:</div><div>If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price" –</div><div>'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.</div></p><p><div>The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,</div><div>We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn,</div><div>When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,</div><div>But I made up my mind that I had to go on.</div></p><p><div>I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.</div><div>There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had.</div><div>When<a href="http://mulhod.github.io/bob_dylan_lyrics/songs/html/isis_1.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> I saw that my partner was just being friendly –</div><div>When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.</div></p><p><div>I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,</div><div>Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover,</div><div>I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,</div><div>Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.</div></p><p><div>She was there in the meadow, where the creek used to rise,</div><div>Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.</div><div>I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,</div><div>I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.</div></p><p><div>She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."</div><div>She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."</div><div>She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."</div><div>She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"</div></p><p><div>Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,</div><div>What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,</div><div>I still can remember the way that you smiled</div><div>On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.</div></p><p><div><a name="1"><sup>1</sup></a><small>	"When" sounds a bit awkward here in terms of the meaning of the line, but I believe that it means something like "but then" in this context.</small></div></p></body></html>
