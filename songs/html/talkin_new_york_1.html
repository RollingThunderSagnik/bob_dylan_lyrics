  Talkin' New York
 </h1>
 <body>
  <p>
   <div>
    Rambling outta the Wild West,
   </div>
   <div>
    Leaving the towns I love the best,
   </div>
   <div>
    Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
   </div>
   <div>
    Till I come into New York town:
   </div>
   <div>
    People going down to the ground,
   </div>
   <div>
    Buildings going up to the sky.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Wintertime in New York town,
   </div>
   <div>
    The wind blowing the snow around,
   </div>
   <div>
    Walk around with nowhere to go,
   </div>
   <div>
    Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
   </div>
   <div>
    I froze right to the bone.
   </div>
   <div>
    New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
   </div>
   <div>
    I didn't feel so cold then.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    I swung on to my old guitar,
   </div>
   <div>
    Grabbed hold of a subway car,
   </div>
   <div>
    And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
   </div>
   <div>
    I landed up on the downtown side,
   </div>
   <div>
    Greenwich Village.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    I walked down there and ended up
   </div>
   <div>
    In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
   </div>
   <div>
    I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
   </div>
   <div>
    Man there said, “Come back some other day.
   </div>
   <div>
    You sound like a hillbilly.
   </div>
   <div>
    We want folksingers here.”
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
   </div>
   <div>
    Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
   </div>
   <div>
    I blowed inside out and upside down,
   </div>
   <div>
    The man there said he loved my sound,
   </div>
   <div>
    He was raving about how he loved my sound –
   </div>
   <div>
    Dollar a day's worth.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
   </div>
   <div>
    I finally got a job in New York town.
   </div>
   <div>
    In a bigger place, bigger money too,
   </div>
   <div>
    Even joined a union, paid my dues.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Now, a very great man once said
   </div>
   <div>
    That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
   </div>
   <div>
    It don't take too long to find out
   </div>
   <div>
    Just what he was talking about.
   </div>
   <div>
    A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
   </div>
   <div>
    But they got a lot of forks and knives –
   </div>
   <div>
    And they gotta cut something.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    So, one morning when the sun was warm
   </div>
   <div>
    I rambled out of New York town,
   </div>
   <div>
    Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
   </div>
   <div>
    Headed out for the western skies.
   </div>
   <div>
    So long, New York!
   </div>
   <div>
    Howdy, East Orange!
