<html><h1>The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest</h1><body><p><div>Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.</div><div>So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens</div><div>And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,</div><div>Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."</div></p><p><div>Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,</div><div>But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.</div><div>"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,</div><div>But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."</div></p><p><div>Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.</div><div>But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."</div><div>"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."</div><div>Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."</div><div>"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.</div><div>"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."</div><div>"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.</div><div>"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."</div></p><p><div>Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean</div><div>When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,</div><div>Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?</div><div>Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."</div><div>"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.</div><div>"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."</div><div>"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.</div><div>"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."</div><div>Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran</div><div>Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.</div><div>"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"</div><div>"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."</div></p><p><div>Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control</div><div>Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.</div><div>He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun</div><div>With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.</div><div>Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap</div><div>And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.</div><div>For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst</div><div>Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.</div><div>No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest â€“</div><div>Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,</div><div>And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed</div><div>And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."</div></p><p><div>Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song</div><div>Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.</div><div>So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load</div><div>And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.</div></p></body></html>
