It's a little strange that this type of mistake occurs with this degree of frequency in this particular album, yet nowhere else as far as I can remember. It seems that in creating this album Dylan was aiming for a very Biblical style of lyrics and, in his attempt to write in a style not as natural to him as the writing styles of his earlier albums, I believe he falls prey to hypercorrection.</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/john_wesley_harding.html">Back</a></li></ul></body></html>
