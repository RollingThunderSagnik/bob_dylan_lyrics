<html><h1>I Pity the Poor Immigrant</h1><body><p><div>I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,</div><div>Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,</div><div>That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom<a href="/home/mmulholland/Documents/bob_dylan_lyrics/songs/html/i_pity_the_poor_immigrant_1.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> lies with every breath,</div><div>Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.</div></p><p><div>I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,</div><div>Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,</div><div>Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,</div><div>Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.</div></p><p><div>I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,</div><div>Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,</div><div>Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.</div><div>I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.</div></p><p><div><a name="1"><sup>1</sup></a><small>	Here Dylan makes the same grammatical mistake that he made in <a href="http://mulhod.github.io/bob_dylan_lyrics/songs/html/i_dreamed_i_saw_st_augustine_1.html">"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine"</a>, also on <a href="http://mulhod.github.io/bob_dylan_lyrics/albums/john_wesley_harding.html"><i>John Wesley Harding</i></a>, but this time he does it twice within the very same line. It's a little strange that this type of mistake occurs with this degree of frequency in this particular album, yet nowhere else as far as I can remember. It seems that in creating this album Dylan was aiming for a very Biblical style of lyrics and, in his attempt to write in a style not as natural to him as the writing styles of his earlier albums, I believe he falls prey to hypercorrection.</small></div></p></body></html>
