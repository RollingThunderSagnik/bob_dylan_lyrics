<html><h1>Went to See the Gypsy</h1><body><p><div>I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,</div><div>He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."</div><div>His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.</div><div>"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.</div></p><p><div>I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,</div><div>A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,</div><div>"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,</div><div>Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror â€“</div><div>He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"</div></p><p><div>Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,</div><div>I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.</div><div>I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,</div><div>The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone</div><div>And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,</div><div>So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,</div><div>From the little Minnesota town.</div></p></body></html>
