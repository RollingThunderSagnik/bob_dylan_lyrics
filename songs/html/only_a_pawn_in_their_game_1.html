  Only a Pawn in Their Game

    A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
   </div>
   <div>
    A finger fired the trigger to his name,
   </div>
   <div>
    A handle hid out in the dark,
   </div>
   <div>
    A hand set the spark,
   </div>
   <div>
    Two eyes took the aim
   </div>
   <div>
    Behind a man's brain.
   </div>
   <div>
    But he can't be blamed,
   </div>
   <div>
    He's only a pawn in their game.
   </div>

   <div>
    A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
   </div>
   <div>
    You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
   </div>
   <div>
    You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
   </div>
   <div>
    And the Negro's name
   </div>
   <div>
    Is used, it is plain,
   </div>
   <div>
    For the politician's gain,
   </div>
   <div>
    As he rises to fame
   </div>
   <div>
    And the poor white remains
   </div>
   <div>
    On the caboose of the train.
   </div>
   <div>
    But it ain't him to blame,
   </div>
   <div>
    He's only a pawn in their game.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
   </div>
   <div>
    And the marshals and cops get the same.
   </div>
   <div>
    But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
   </div>
   <div>
    He's taught in his school
   </div>
   <div>
    From the start by the rule
   </div>
   <div>
    That the laws are with him,
   </div>
   <div>
    To protect his white skin,
   </div>
   <div>
    To keep up his hate,
   </div>
   <div>
    So he never thinks straight
   </div>
   <div>
    'Bout the shape that he's in.
   </div>
   <div>
    But it ain't him to blame,
   </div>
   <div>
    He's only a pawn in their game.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
   </div>
   <div>
    And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
   </div>
   <div>
    And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
   </div>
   <div>
    Shoot in the back
   </div>
   <div>
    With his fist in a clinch,
   </div>
   <div>
    To hang and to lynch,
   </div>
   <div>
    To hide 'neath a hood,
   </div>
   <div>
    To kill with no pain.
   </div>
   <div>
    Like a dog on a chain,
   </div>
   <div>
    He ain't-a got no name.
   </div>
   <div>
    But it ain't him to blame,
   </div>
   <div>
    He's only a pawn in their game.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
   </div>
   <div>
    They lowered him down as a king,
   </div>
   <div>
    But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
   </div>
   <div>
    That fired the gun,
   </div>
   <div>
    He'll see by his grave
   </div>
   <div>
    On the stone that remains,
   </div>
   <div>
    Carved next to his name,
   </div>
   <div>
    His epitaph plain:
   </div>
   <div>
    “Only a Pawn in Their Game.”
