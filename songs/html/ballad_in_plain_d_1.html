Her skin, it was bronze.</div><div>With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.</div><div>I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,</div><div>Gone as the season she's taken.</div></p><p><div>In a young summer's youth, I stole her away</div><div>From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.</div><div>Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,</div><div>With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.</div></p><p><div>Of the two sisters, I loved the young.</div><div>With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.</div><div>The constant scapegoat<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>, she was easily undone</div><div>By the jealousy of others around her.</div></p><p><div>For her parasite sister I had no respect.</div><div>Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,</div><div>Countless visions of the other she'd reflect</div><div>As a crutch for her scenes and her society.</div></p><p><div>Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.</div><div>The changes I was going through can't even be used</div><div>For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose</div><div>The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.</div></p><p><div>With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip</div><div>A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,</div><div>Noticing not that I'd already slipped</div><div>To the sin of love's false security.</div></p><p><div>From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,</div><div>Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies</div><div>Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,</div><div>What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"</div></p><p><div>And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,</div><div>The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.</div><div>At the peak of the night the king and the queen</div><div>Tumbled all down into pieces.</div></p><p><div>The tragic figure. her sister did shout,</div><div>"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"</div><div>And I, in my armor, turning about</div><div>And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.</div></p><p><div>Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,</div><div>Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.</div><div>And she in between, the victim of sound,</div><div>Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.</div></p><p><div>All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!</div><div>I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.</div><div>My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,</div><div>Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.</div></p><p><div>The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.</div><div>The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.</div><div>I think of her often and hope whoever she's met</div><div>Will be fully aware of how precious she is.</div></p><p><div>Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,</div><div>"How goodâ€“how good does it feel to be free?"</div><div>And I answer them most mysteriously,</div><div>"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"</div></p><p><div><a name="1"><sup>1</sup></a><small>	Dylan pronounces this word as if it were "scrapegoat".</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/another_side_of_bob_dylan.html">Back</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
