planning for a fall,</div><div>The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,</div><div>The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,</div><div>Anyone with any sense had already left town;</div><div>He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,</div><div>Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,</div><div>And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,</div><div>"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"</div><div>Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,</div><div>Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.</div><div>Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,</div><div>A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,</div><div>Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,</div><div>He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.</div><div>With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,</div><div>He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,</div><div>But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,</div><div>She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.</div><div>She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,</div><div>"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:</div><div>He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div><i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,</div><div><i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.</div><div>But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim</div><div>And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,</div><div>Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,</div><div>She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.</div><div>She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs</div><div>With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,</div><div>But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,</div><div>The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.</div><div>It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring</div><div>And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –</div><div>No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,</div><div>She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.</div><div>She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,</div><div>Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –</div><div>She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>Lily took her dress off, buried it away,</div><div>"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.</div><div>Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,</div><div>I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."</div><div>Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,</div><div>"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."</div><div>He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,</div><div>As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –</div><div>There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:</div><div>The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked</div><div>And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,</div><div>Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –</div><div>She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall</div><div>And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.</div><div>In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground</div><div>For one more member, who had business back in town,</div><div>For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,</div><div>Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,</div><div>And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,</div><div>The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,</div><div>The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.</div></p><p><div>The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",</div><div>Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.</div><div>She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,</div><div>Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,</div><div>But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.</div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li
