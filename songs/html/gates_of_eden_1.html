This sentence cannot be parsed as it is and the problem lies in the transcription, specifically the phrase, "[t]hough it shadows metal badge", which should include an <i>s</i> after "it". It perhaps makes sense then to interpret the <i>s</i> as the possessive clitic <i>'s</i> and, in turn, to parse "its shadow's metal badge" as the subject of the subordinate clause beginning with "[t]hough". For a fuller discussion of this verse, see Paul Williams's interpretation in his book <i>Bob Dylan: Performing Artist 1986–1990 &amp; Beyond</i>, pg. 122.</small></div></p></body></html>
