Cut the engines, change the sail,</div><div>Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody</div><div>Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.</div></p><p><div>"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.</div><div>I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.</div><div>Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.</div><div>He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."</div><div>Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/</div><div>He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.</div></p><p><div>Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.</div><div>I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,</div><div>Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,</div><div>Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".</div><div>I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"</div><div>When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.</div></p><p><div>I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.</div><div>I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.</div><div>The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.</div><div>I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"</div><div>Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.</div><div>Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.</div></p><p><div>Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank</div><div>To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.</div><div>They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.</div><div>They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,</div><div>Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend</div><div>Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.</div></p><p><div>Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.</div><div>I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."</div><div>The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"</div><div>I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!</div><div>Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"</div><div>I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.</div></p><p><div>I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,</div><div>I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"</div><div>As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood</div><div>Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.</div><div>I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,</div><div>But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.</div></p><p><div>I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.</div><div>He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."</div><div>I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street</div><div>When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.</div><div>A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.</div><div>When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.</div></p><p><div>Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab</div><div>At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.</div><div>I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails</div><div>Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.</div><div>So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.</div><div>It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.</div></p><p><div>Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.</div><div>I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.</div><div>They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.</div><div>They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.</div><div>I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.</div><div>They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.</div></p><p><div>Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale</div><div>That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.</div><div>But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,</div><div>I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.</div><div>I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.</div><div>He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".</div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="javascript:history.back()">Back</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
