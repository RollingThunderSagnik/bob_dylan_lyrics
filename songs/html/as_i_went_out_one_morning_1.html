<html><h1>As I Went Out One Morning</h1><body><p><div>As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,</div><div>I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.</div><div>I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.</div><div>I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.</div></p><p><div>"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.</div><div>Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."</div><div>"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.</div><div>"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."</div></p><p><div>Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,</div><div>Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.</div><div>And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.</div><div>"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."</div></p></body></html>
