But I have a nagging doubt that this interpretation of the lyrics is correct. First of all, I have no idea what "the big McMillan" refers to and, secondly, it does not sound to me like Dylan even says "McMillan" (and the first verse is repeated for the final verse of the song, so there are two chances to hear the line sung).</small></div><div><a name="2"><sup>2</sup></a><small>	Throughout this song Dylan often pronounces "Sarah" as though it ends with an "o" ("Saro Jane" is how other lyrics sources make it out).</small></div></p></body></html>
