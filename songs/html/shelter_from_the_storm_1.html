<html><h1>Shelter from the Storm</h1><body><p><div>'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,</div><div>When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,</div><div>I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,</div><div>I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:</div><div>In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,</div><div>Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –</div><div>Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,</div><div>Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,</div><div>Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there</div><div>With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,</div><div>She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,</div><div>I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –</div><div>Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,</div><div>But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts</div><div>And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove</div><div>And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –</div><div>Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,</div><div>I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,</div><div>I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p><p><div>Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,</div><div>Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine</div><div>If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:</div><div>"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."</div></p></body></html>
