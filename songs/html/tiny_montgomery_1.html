But, unlike "Apple Suckling Tree", "Tiny Montgomery" has a direction and a theme and it does not seem like the lyrics are being made up as the song goes along, even if some of the specific words are not finished yet. It's almost like this recording represents a stage in the creative process that is one or two steps past the stage that "Apple Suckling Tree" was at when it was recorded, so this transcription is meant to represent not merely the bare outline of the song, as "Apple Suckling Tree" does, but rather an almost complete song. Therefore, there are places in the lyrics where a transcription is practically impossible. In those cases, I will provide notes or at least italicize the lyrics in question to set them apart from the rest of the song.</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/the_basement_tapes.html">Back</a></li></ul></body></html>
