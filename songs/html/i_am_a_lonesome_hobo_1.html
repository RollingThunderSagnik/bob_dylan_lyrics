<html><h1>I Am a Lonesome Hobo</h1><body><p><div>I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.</div><div>Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.</div><div>I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.</div><div>And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.</div></p><p><div>Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.</div><div>I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.</div><div>But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,</div><div>Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.</div></p><p><div>Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.</div><div>But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:</div><div>Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,</div><div>And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.</div></p></body></html>
