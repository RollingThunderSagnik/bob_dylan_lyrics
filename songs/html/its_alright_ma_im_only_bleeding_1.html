A lot of the lyrics in this song are fragmentary and difficult to put together and some of the verses are not even complete sentences, almost as if they're unfinished thoughts or images. With that in mind, even if my interpretation of this verse seems to be incomplete, I think that that may be how it is no matter how one looks at it. I don't believe, after studying these lyrics intently, that there is a different interpretation under which the verse would make complete sense grammatically, even though there certainly are other valid ways to interpret the verse.</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/bringing_it_all_back_home.html">Back</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
