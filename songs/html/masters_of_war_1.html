<html><h1>Masters of War</h1><body><p><div>Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,</div><div>You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,</div><div>You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks.</div><div>I just want you to know I can see through your masks.</div></p><p><div>You that never done nothing but build to destroy,</div><div>You play with my world like it's your little toy.</div><div>You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes</div><div>And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.</div></p><p><div>Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive.</div><div>A world war can be won you want me to believe.</div><div>But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain</div><div>Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.</div></p><p><div>You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire.</div><div>Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher.</div><div>And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood</div><div>Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.</div></p><p><div>You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,</div><div>Fear to bring children into the world.</div><div>For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,</div><div>You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.</div></p><p><div>How much do I know, to talk out of turn?</div><div>You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.</div><div>But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:</div><div>That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.</div></p><p><div>Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?</div><div>Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?</div><div>I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,</div><div>All the money you made will never buy back your soul.</div></p><p><div>And I hope that you die and your death will come soon.</div><div>I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon</div><div>And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed</div><div>And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.</div></p></body></html>
