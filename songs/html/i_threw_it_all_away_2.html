<html><h1>I Threw It All Away</h1><body><p><div>I once held her in my arms,</div><div>She said she would always stay,</div><div>But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,</div><div>I threw it all away,</div><div>I threw it all away.</div></p><p><div>Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand</div><div>And rivers that ran through every day,</div><div>But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,</div><div>I threw it all away,</div><div>I threw it all away.</div></p><p><div>Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,</div><div>Love and only love – it can't be denied.</div><div>No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –</div><div>Take a tip from a-one who's tried.</div><div>So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,</div><div>Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.</div><div>One thing for sure: there ain't no cure</div><div>If you throw it all away,</div><div>If you throw it all away.</div></p></body></html>
