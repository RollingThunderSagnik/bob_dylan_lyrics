I don't have any idea where this wholesale revision came from, but this in one example of the many differences between the real world and the world according to Bob Dylan and those who manage and have managed the compilation of his lyrics (I know that Dylan actually did revise many songs when his <i>Lyrics</i> book was being put together). In any case, the transcription that I provide for this line is pure guesswork, something that will become more and more common as the years pass in Dylan's career (<a href="http://mulhod.github.io/bob_dylan_lyrics/albums/the_basement_tapes.html"><i>The Basement Tapes</i></a> being notorious for this reason), but I will always make a note if I believe some transcription is not solid or is questionable or if I just have no clue what the lyrics are.</small></div><div><a name="2"><sup>2</sup></a><small>	I believe that in this instance the form of "to be" is omitted, so the line has the meaning.</small></div></p></body></html>
