 <h1>
  When the Ship Comes In
 </h1>

  <p>
   <div>
    Oh, the time will come up
   </div>
   <div>
    When the winds will stop
   </div>
   <div>
    And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
   </div>
   <div>
    Like the stillness in the wind
   </div>
   <div>
    Before the hurricane begins,
   </div>
   <div>
    The hour that the ship comes in.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    And the sea will split
   </div>
   <div>
    And the ships will hit
   </div>
   <div>
    And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking.
   </div>
   <div>
    And the tide will sound
   </div>
   <div>
    And the waves will pound
   </div>
   <div>
    And the morning will be breaking.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    The fishes will laugh
   </div>
   <div>
    As they swim out of the path
   </div>
   <div>
    And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
   </div>
   <div>
    And the rocks on the sand
   </div>
   <div>
    Will proudly stand,
   </div>
   <div>
    The hour that the ship comes in.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    And the words that are used
   </div>
   <div>
    For to get the ship confused
   </div>
   <div>
    Will not be understood as they're spoken
   </div>
   <div>
    For the chains of the sea
   </div>
   <div>
    Will have busted in the night
   </div>
   <div>
    And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    A song will lift
   </div>
   <div>
    As the mainsail shifts
   </div>
   <div>
    And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
   </div>
   <div>
    And the sun will respect
   </div>
   <div>
    Every face on the deck,
   </div>
   <div>
    The hour that the ship comes in.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    And the sands will roll
   </div>
   <div>
    Out a carpet of gold
   </div>
   <div>
    For your weary toes to be touching
   </div>
   <div>
    And the ship's wise men
   </div>
   <div>
    Will remind you once again
   </div>
   <div>
    That the whole, wide world is watching.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Oh, the foes will rise
   </div>
   <div>
    With the sleep still in their eyes
   </div>
   <div>
    And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
   </div>
   <div>
    But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
   </div>
   <div>
    And they'll know that it's for real,
   </div>
   <div>
    The hour when the ship comes in.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    And they'll raise their hands,
   </div>
   <div>
    Saying, “We'll meet all your demands.”
   </div>
   <div>
    But we'll shout from the bow, “Your days are numbered!”
   </div>
   <div>
    And, like Pharaoh's tribe,
   </div>
   <div>
    They'll be drownded in the tide
   </div>
   <div>
    And, like Goliath, they'll be conquered.
   </div>
