 <h1>
  A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall

    Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
   </div>
   <div>
    And where have you been, my darling young one?
   </div>
   <div>
    I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
   </div>
   <div>
    I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
   </div>
   <div>
    I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
   </div>
   <div>
    I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
   </div>
   <div>
    I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
   </div>
   <div>
    And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
   </div>
   <div>
    It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
   </div>
   <div>
    And what did you see, my darling young one?
   </div>
   <div>
    I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
   </div>
   <div>
    I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
   </div>
   <div>
    I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
   </div>
   <div>
    I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
   </div>
   <div>
    I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
   </div>
   <div>
    I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
   </div>
   <div>
    I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
   </div>
   <div>
    And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
   </div>
   <div>
    It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
   </div>
   <div>
    And what did you hear, my darling young one?
   </div>
   <div>
    I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
   </div>
   <div>
    I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
   </div>
   <div>
    I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
   </div>
   <div>
    I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
   </div>
   <div>
    I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
   </div>
   <div>
    I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
   </div>
   <div>
    I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
   </div>
   <div>
    And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
   </div>
   <div>
    It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
   </div>
   <div>
    And who did you meet, my darling young one?
   </div>
   <div>
    I met a young child beside a dead pony,
   </div>
   <div>
    I met a white man who walked a black dog,
   </div>
   <div>
    I met a young woman whose body was burning,
   </div>
   <div>
    I met a young girl â€“ she gave me a rainbow,
   </div>
   <div>
    I met one man who was wounded in love,
   </div>
   <div>
    I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
   </div>
   <div>
    And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
   </div>
   <div>
    It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
   </div>
  </p>
  <p>
   <div>
    And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
   </div>
   <div>
    And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
   </div>
   <div>
    I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
   </div>
   <div>
    I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
   </div>
   <div>
    Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
   </div>
   <div>
    Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
   </div>
   <div>
    Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
   </div>
   <div>
    And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
   </div>
   <div>
    Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
   </div>
   <div>
    Where black is the color, where none is the number,
   </div>
   <div>
    And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
   </div>
   <div>
    And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
   </div>
   <div>
    And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
   </div>
   <div>
    But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
   </div>
   <div>
    And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
   </div>
   <div>
    It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
   </div>
