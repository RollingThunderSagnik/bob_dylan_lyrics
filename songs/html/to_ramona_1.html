<html><h1>To Ramona</h1><body><p><div>Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.</div><div>The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise</div><div>For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes</div><div>And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.</div></p><p><div>Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.</div><div>Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.</div><div>But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.</div><div>It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.</div></p><p><div>I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.</div><div>I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.</div><div>You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.</div><div>Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.</div></p><p><div>I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.</div><div>If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.</div><div>From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,</div><div>That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.</div></p><p><div>I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring</div><div>For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.</div><div>Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.</div><div>And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.</div></p></body></html>
