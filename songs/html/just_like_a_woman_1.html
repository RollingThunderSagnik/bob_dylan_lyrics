<html><h1>Just Like a Woman</h1><body><p><div>Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.</div><div>Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,</div><div>But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.</div><div>She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!</div><div>She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!</div><div>And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.</div></p><p><div>Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.</div><div>Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed</div><div>Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.</div><div>She takes just like a woman – yes!</div><div>She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!</div><div>And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.</div></p><p><div>It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.</div><div>And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.</div><div>I can't stay in here – ain't it clear</div><div>That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.</div><div>And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,</div><div>Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.</div><div>Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!</div><div>You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!</div><div>Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.</div></p></body></html>
