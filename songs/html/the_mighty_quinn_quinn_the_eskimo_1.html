However, under that interpretation there is no form of "to be" at all, which, though not standard English, is certainly a well-known feature of non-standard English dialects and is heard often in Dylan's lyrics.</small></div><div><a name="2"><sup>2</sup></a><small>	Elsewhere this lyric has been represented as: "A cat's meow and a cow's moo". There are a few things I believe that I can say with some certainty about the lyrics of this version: 1) The last word is definitely not "moo" and most likely "meow", 2) likewise, the first <i>m</i>-word is probably not "meow" and most likely "moo" (going on the idea that these two words are the only two options), though I believe Dylan himself gets a little confused at the beginning, pronouncing a sort of "mee-oo"-sound because he starts saying "meow" accidentally before finishing with a clear <i>oo</i>-sound, 3) I believe that one of Dylan's themes in this song was the mixing up of some common idioms (see: "I like my sugar sweet" and "it ain't my cup of meat" from the second verse), so it makes sense when he sings of a "cat's moo" and a "calf's meow". As for "calf", it's pretty clear if one listens to the version slowly that not only is the vowel of the second <i>m</i>-word like that of the first, but that it ends in <i>f</i> too, so it sounds very different from "cow", and, furthermore, "calf" retains the meaning of "cow".</small></div></p></body></html>
