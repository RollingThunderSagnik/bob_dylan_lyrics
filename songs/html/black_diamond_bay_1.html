She said, "That ain't enough."</div><div>Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,</div><div>She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".</div><div>She knocked upon it anyway</div><div>As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.</div></p><p><div>"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.</div><div>He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"</div><div>Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,</div><div>The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,</div><div>The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",</div><div>As the stars fell down and the moons fade away<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> on Black Diamond Bay.</div></p><p><div>As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.</div><div>The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."</div><div>The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,</div><div>Well<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>, she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."4</div><div>She sheds a tear and then begins to pray</div><div>As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.</div></p><p><div>I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,</div><div>It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.</div><div>It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,</div><div>Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear</div><div>And there's really nothing anyone can say –</div><div>And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.</div></p><p><div><a name="1"><sup>1</sup></a><small>	Translation of the French: "Wait, please".</small></div><div><a name="2"><sup>2</sup></a><small>	Other lyrics sources present an alternate (but obviously incorrect) lyric here: "As the starts fell down and the fields burned away".</small></div><div><a name="3"><sup>3</sup></a><small>	It seems that Dylan meant to say "while" here, but what comes out sounds more like "well".</small></div><div><a name="4"><sup>4</sup></a><small>	Translation of the French: "I love you a lot". This is a reference to a popular song written by Anna Sosenko in 1935 called "Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup", which, although grammatically correct, is a deliberate attempt at bad French.</small></div></p><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="../../albums/desire.html">Back</a></li></ul></body></html>
