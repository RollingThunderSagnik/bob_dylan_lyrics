<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>**1**

Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.

From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.

It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!

**1** With the audience clapping derisively, Dylan begins to mumble into the microphone as if he's telling a story. Eventually the crowd quiets down in order to hear what he's saying, which was obviously his aim in mumbling into the microphone, at which point Dylan stops mumbling and very clearly ends with, “if you only just wouldn't clap so hard”. Satisfied with the ensuing silence, Dylan and the Band begin the next song.
