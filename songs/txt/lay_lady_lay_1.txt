Lay**1**, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you?

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
I long to see you in the morning light,
I long to reach for you in the night.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.

**1** The correct verb to use would technically be “lie” (she lies, she lay, she has lain), not “lay”, which is the transitive form of “lie”. However, the distinction between the two forms has been increasingly disappearing in English due at least partially to the fact that the base form of the verb <i>lay</i> looks and sounds exactly the same as the simple past form of <i>lay</i>. But just because the use of <i>lay</i> in this song is technically incorrect doesn't mean that it was not intentional: it would not sound right to hear “lie, lady, lie, lie across my big brass bed” (because of the assonance) and, besides, this is how real people talk every day and there's nothing wrong with it.
