Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight? 
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone? 
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory 
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?

Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
How**1** you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last? 
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright? 
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?

Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last? 
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright? 
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?

**1** I'm not sure this transcription is correct. In the next verse, which is a repeat of this verse, Dylan says simply “and”.
