They say everything can be replaced,
Yet every distance is not near,
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Crying out that he been framed.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.

They say every man need protection,
They tell me every man must fall,
But I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
I shall be released,
I shall be released,
I shall be released,
I shall be released.

<i>Thank you.</i>
