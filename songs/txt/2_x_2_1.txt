One by one they followed the sun,
One by one until there were none,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Six by six they were playing with tricks.

How many paths did they try and fail?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How much poison did they inhale?
How many black cats crossed their trail?

Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Ten by ten they drank it again.

How many tomorrows have they given away?
How many compared to yesterday?
How many more without any reward?
How many more can they afford?

Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Four by four they turn it some more.
One by one they follow the sun,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Six by six...**1**

**1** From “Three by three” on down in this last verse, none of the transcribed lyrics included here are in the “official” lyrics versions included on Bob Dylan's <a href="bobdylan.com">website</a>, etc. Therefore, they are only guesses and could be off the mark considerably. After the line beginning “Six by six”, Dylan continues, though it is almost inaudible. There may even be a line afterwards beginning "Seven by seven", but by that point the music has faded a way to such a degree that is practically inaudible.
