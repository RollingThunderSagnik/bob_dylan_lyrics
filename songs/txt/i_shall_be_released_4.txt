They say everything can be replaced,
Yet every distance is not near,
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here.
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

They say every man needs protection,
They say every man must fall,
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame.**1**
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Crying out that he was framed.
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

**1** The phrasing here seems a bit awkward. It is possible the Dylan is sort of accidentally combining several different versions. For example, from the version that appears on <i><a href="../../albums/bob_dylans_greatest_hits_volume_ii.html">Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, Volume II</a></i> and <i><a href="../../albums/biograph.html">Biograph</a></i>, this line and the following line are: "Down here next to me in this lonely crowd, / There's a man who swears he's not to blame." On the <i><a href="../../albums/before_the_flood.html">Before the Flood</a></i> version, the lines are: "Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd, / A man who swears he's not to blame." There are still other phrasings in other versions of the song.
