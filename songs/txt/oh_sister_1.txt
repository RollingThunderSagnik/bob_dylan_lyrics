Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger.

Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
To love and follow His direction?

We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
We died and were reborn and then**1** mysteriously saved.
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
You may not see me tomorrow.

**1** According to other lyrics sources, this word is "then". However, what's actually sung by Dylan and Emmylou Harris does not sound that much like the word "then". Whatever is sung seems to start with <i>l</i> and end with a fricative (<i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>th</i>, etc.), or at least have a fricative near the end, which leads me to believe that it might actually be the word "left". If "then" is incorrect, "left" makes the most sense since it fits the phonetic description and makes sense semantically and syntactically. However, I have chosen to stick with "then" only because in the versions of “Oh, Sister” from <i>Hard Rain</i> and <i>At Budokan</i>, "then" is sung pretty clearly.
