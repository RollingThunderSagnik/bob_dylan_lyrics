The water is wide and I can’t cross over.
Give me the wings and I could fly,
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row, my love and I.

There's a ship and it sails on the sea,
Loaded deep as deep can be,
But not as deep as the love I’m in.
I know not if I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against an oak,
Thinking it was a trusty tree,
But the first it bent and then it broke
Just like my own false love to me.

Now, love is gentle, love is kind,
Gay as a jewel when first it’s new,
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like some morning dew.

The water is wide and I can’t cross over
And neither have I wings to fly.
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row, my love and I.
