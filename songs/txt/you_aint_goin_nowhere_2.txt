Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!

I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!

Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!

Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
“But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!”
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
