<i>Just Like a Woman? Alright, we'll -- we'll try it.</i>

Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bow have fallen from her curls.
But she takes just like a woman,
She aches just like a woman,
And she makes love just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess that a-baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman,
And she aches just like a woman,
And she makes love just like a woman, and she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first and I was a-dying out there of thirst so I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here â€“ ain't it clear
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's a-time for us to quit.
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Well, you take just like a woman,
And you fake just like a woman,
And you even make love just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
