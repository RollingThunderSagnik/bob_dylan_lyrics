Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But, if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.

Well**1**, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
But, if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.

I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But, if I will save you the**2** time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.

**1** What Dylan says something here unclear. I have chosen to transcribe it as “Well”, but it could be something quite different.
**2** In previous verses, Dylan sings “any” here. However, in this case I believe he's saying “the”, though it is a bit unclear.
