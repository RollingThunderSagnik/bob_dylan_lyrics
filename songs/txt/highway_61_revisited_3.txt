Abe said, “Man, you must be putting me on.”
God said, “No.” Abe said, “What?”

Next time you see me coming you better run.”
Abe said, “Where you want this killing done?”
God said, “On Highway 61.”

Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
He asked poor Howard, “Where can I go?”
Howard said, “There's only one place I know.”

Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
“I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.

Then said, “Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Take it on down to Highway 61.”

Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right.
“My complexion,” she said, “is much too white.”
He said, “Come over here, girl, step into the light.”

And they were both out on Highway 61.

Roving gambler, he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.

But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Have it on Highway 61.”
