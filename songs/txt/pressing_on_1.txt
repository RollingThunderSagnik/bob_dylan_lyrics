Well, I'm pressing on,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.

Said I'm pressing on,
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.

Pressing on,
Pressing on,
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.

Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Say, “Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign.”
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
I just keep pressing on,
Pressing on,
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.

Pressing on,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.

Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
But I'm pressing on,
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.

Well, I'm pressing on,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.

Pressing on,
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!**1**
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.

**1** It is very difficult to tell what Dylan is singing in the latter half of this line. The phrase probably starts with the interjection <i>yeah</i> (however, there is no distinct <i>y</i>), and the second word is probably either "leading" or "believing" or something similar, and I believe the last part is "the way" (but I have some doubt for that part, as well).
