Got a little girl, who's little and low,
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Can't stand back**1**, swear you gotta step it up and go!

Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!

Front door shut, back door too,
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!

Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!

Me and my baby walking down the street,
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!

Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!

Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!

Well!
Oh!
Yeah, man!

**1** This word had been transcribed as “pat” and I believe that this transcription is true for most of the verses in this song except for this verse, the second-to-last verse, and the last verse, in which it sounds like Dylan says “back”.
