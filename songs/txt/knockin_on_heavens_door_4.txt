Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore.
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Just like so many times before.**1**

Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
I can't see through it anymore.
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side**2**
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I can't fight them anymore.
That long, black train is pulling down
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

**1** The chorus is sung by the band and partially by Dylan. Sometimes he sings the “knocking on heaven's door” part with the band, sometimes he repeats it after the line has finished, sometimes he seems to start singing it a little earlier than he perhaps should, and sometimes he sings more or less of the line or does not sing at all. In any case, the singing of the chorus is presented as though it is sung entirely and perfectly in sequence because it would be chaotic otherwise.
**2** I'm not sure exactly what Dylan sings here. It's a notable change to what Dylan has sung in other versions.
