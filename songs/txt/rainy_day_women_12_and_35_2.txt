They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Because everybody must get stoned.

They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Because everybody must get stoned.

They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,**1**
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Because everybody must get stoned.

They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Because everybody must get stoned.

**1** I have a suspicion that I am actually hearing this line correctly and that it just plain doesn't make sense and that Dylan perhaps stumbles, having to improvise the lyrics. But, then again, these lyrics are so different from the original album version and other versions of the song that I can't be sure that Dylan is even stumbling. The lyrics just seem to be full of odd phrases, wordings that have some quality that is slightly off, i.e., “...when you're walking on the path”, “...when you're riding in your seat”, “...I wouldn't feel too all alone...”, etc.
