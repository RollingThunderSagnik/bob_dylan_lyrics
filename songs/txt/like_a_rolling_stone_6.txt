<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>

Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, “Beware, doll,
You're bound to fall.” You thought they were all kidding you.
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out.
Now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?

You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you wanna make a deal?”
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
You never understood that it ain't no good,
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he's taken anything**1** he can steal?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?

**1** Though I am confident that Dylan says “anything” in this version (as opposed to “everything”), I feel that I should at least make a note of the difference since they are so alike.
