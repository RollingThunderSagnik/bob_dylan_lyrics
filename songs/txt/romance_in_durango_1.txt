Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
I think this time we should escape.

Sold my guitar to the baker's son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
But I can get another one
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.

No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,**1**
Soon the horse will take us to Durango**2**.
Agárrame, mi vida**3**, soon the desert will be gone,
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.

Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.

No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

At the corrida**4** we'll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero**5** stand alone,
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreón**6**.

Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church a-this side of town,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.

The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Already the fiesta has begun,
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.

No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Oh, can it be that I am slain?

Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Aim well, my little one,
We may not make it through the night.

No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
