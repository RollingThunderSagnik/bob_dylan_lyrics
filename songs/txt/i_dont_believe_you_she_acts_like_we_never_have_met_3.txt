<i>This is called “I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)”.</i>**1**

Well, I can't understand,
She let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall.
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Why she did go,
But I can't get close to her at all.
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
She said she would never forget,
But morning is clear
And it's like I ain't here,
She just acts like we never have met.

Well, it's all new to me
Like some mystery,
It could even be like a myth,
But it's hard to think on
That she's the same one
That last night I was with.
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
But am I still dreaming yet?
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once and talk
'Stead of acting like we never have met.

If I didn't have to guess,
I'd gladly confess
To anything I might've tried.
If I was with her too long
Or have done something wrong,
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Though**2** her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
But something has changed
For she ain't the same,
She just acts like we never have met.

I'm leaving today,
I'll be on my way,
Of this I can't say very much,
But, if you want me to,
I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched.
And, if anybody asks me,
“Is it easy to forget?”
I'll say, “It's easily done,
Just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met.”

**1** This transcription reflects the meaning that I get from what Dylan says and how he says it. (I know that Dylan likes really long song titles, too.) But surely Dylan must also be referring to the arrangement of the song and not just the content of the song.
**2** This sounds like it could just be the exclamation “Oh!”. It also happens that, in the original album version, this line begins with “though”, but in this version Dylan switches at this line to the ending of a previous verse (that has been left out of this version).
