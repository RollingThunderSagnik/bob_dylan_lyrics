Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill,
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Yeah, but if I die on top of the hill
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.

Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?

Alright!

Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Alright!
