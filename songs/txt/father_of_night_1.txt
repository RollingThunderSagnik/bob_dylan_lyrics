Father**1** of night, father of day,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Father of love and father of rain.

Father of day, father of night,
Father of black, father of white,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.

Father of grain, father of wheat,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Father of air and father of trees,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.

**1** In the <i>Lyrics</i> version, “father” is capitalized whenever it occurs. Since I don't know what the point of doing it is and because I don't know who decided to do it, I have decided to ignore that capitalization.
