I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Again**1** she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
She keeps this .410**2** all loaded with lead.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

**1** The first part of this line is very difficult to make out. However, it definitely does not begin with "she" or "[t]hen" as <a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/buick-6">the bobdylan.com version</a> and others indicate. I chose to transcribe the first word as "[a]gain", but it seems like there is an <i>r</i>-sound in there somewhere (perhaps the word "here"?).
**2** Sung as "four-ten".
