You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,**1**
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.

You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.

And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.

You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.

And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Never did feel this way before,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.

You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.

**1** Dylan is probably anticipating the beginning lines from the second and third verses (“You angel, you, you're as fine as...”) when he starts the first verse with “You angel, you, you're as f––” and has to quickly switch over to the rest of the “you got me under your wing” line.
