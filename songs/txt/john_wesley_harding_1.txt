John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.

'Twas down in Chaynee County**1**, a time they talk about,
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.

All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
But no charge held against him could they prove.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
He was never known to make a foolish move.

**1** This is how the name of this county is written in Dylan's official lyrics and, though it could be a fictional name, I cannot find any county (or anything similar) with this name. It could be that Dylan is referring to one of several counties with the name Cheyenne, which are in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado, places that seemingly go hand in hand with the subject matter of <a href="../../albums/john_wesley_harding.html"><i>John Wesley Harding</i></a>.
