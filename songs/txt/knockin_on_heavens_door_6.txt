Mama, wipe the blood off of my face,
I can't see through it anymore.
I need someone to talk to and a new hiding place,
I feel like I'm looking at a-heaven's door.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Mama, I can hear that thunder roar,
Going down from God's distant shore.
I can hear Him calling for my soul,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

<i>Thanks for coming. We'll be in the area for a few days. Maybe we'll see you tomorrow at 9.</i>
