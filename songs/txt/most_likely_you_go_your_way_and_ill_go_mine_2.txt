You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
I just can't do what I've done before,
I just can't beg you anymore,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
When you go your way and I go mine.

You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
It can't be this way everywhere –
I'm gonna let you pass,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
When you go your way and I go mine.

The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.

You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
When you go your way and I go mine.
