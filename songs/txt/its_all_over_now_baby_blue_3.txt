You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Look out, the saints are coming through 
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
The sky too is folding over you,
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
The lover who has just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
The carpet too is moving under you,
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew,
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
