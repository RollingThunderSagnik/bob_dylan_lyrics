I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.

Baby, let me follow you down,
Baby, let me follow you down.
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.

Can I come home with you?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me come home with you.

Baby, let me follow you down,
Baby, let me follow you down.
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.
