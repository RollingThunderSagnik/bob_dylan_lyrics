They say everything can be replaced,
Yet every distance is not near,
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

They say every man needs protection,
They say every man must fall,
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

Yonder down here in this lonely crowd,
There's man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him shouting loud,
Crying out that he been framed.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
