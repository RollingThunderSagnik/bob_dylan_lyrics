When your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father, to your sister he explains
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
And you want someone to put out your ambition**1**,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain**2**
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
