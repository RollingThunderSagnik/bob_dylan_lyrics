Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger.**1**

Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
To love and follow His direction?

We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
You may not see me tomorrow.

**1** After each verse Dylan and the backing singers sort of hum along with the music, often with Dylan interjecting loud <i>oh</i>s and <i>ah</i>s.
