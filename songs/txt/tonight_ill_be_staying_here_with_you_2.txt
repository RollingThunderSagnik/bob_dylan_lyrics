Throw my ticket in the wind.
Throw my mattress out there too.
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
That today I'll be staying here with you.

I could have left this town by noon,
By the night and been to some place new,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
So today I'll be staying here with you.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.

Is it really any wonder,
The changes we put on each other's heads?
You came down on me like white thunder,
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
I hear them semis rolling too.
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.

I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
I hear them semis rolling too.
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
