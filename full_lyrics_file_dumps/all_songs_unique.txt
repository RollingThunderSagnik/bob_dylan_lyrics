And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
You and I'll never know."
Tangled up in blue."
From across that lonesome ocean."

Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"

It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
I can't find my knees."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"

Be sixteen come Sunday."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I would want again tomorrow."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
We'll both go off together."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Where you and I will unite."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
And have it on Highway 61."
"Have you seen dignity?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
I'll bring back my lady."
And keep him good company."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
He said, "Tell me about it."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Country'll grow."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
They look as dark as night."
We'll both go home together."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
That you must always first forgive them."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
And pretend that you never have met."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
And punched my cigarette."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
You can't blame us at all."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
It's all for the love of thee."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
So write to her tenderly."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
You can't blame me at all."
But we were tangled up in blue."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Have it on Highway 61."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
And it's all for the love of thee."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
I'll apply them all to thee."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
I'll endow them onto thee."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
I didn't see you around."
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
And you take just like a woman,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Well, I may just swear,
Just to know that you are near,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Father of night, father of day,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
A handle hid out in the dark,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
But now morning is clear,
You married young just like your ma,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
To be alone with you,
I get my sweet reward,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Ever since I been a child,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
And the table's full and overflowed,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
I want you,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
While paupers change possessions,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Never did feel this way before,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
I'd already gone the distance,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Most of the time it's well understood,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
With what your fate is going to be,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
I just say no thanks,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Don't let yourself fall,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
It could even be like a myth,
The sky too is folding over you,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
That you'd have liked me to,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
To shine in through,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
And think they're fooling you,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Don't let me change my heart,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Father of cold and father of heat,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Carved next to his name,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Or have done something wrong,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
But the bottles are done,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
The sky too is folding under you,
If she ain't feeling well,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Come on, come on, stick together,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
God don't call it treason,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Somewhere down the road some day,
You got something I want plenty of,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Now, won't you tell me true,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
You have given all there is to give,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Heart of mine,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Don't let her see that you need her,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
For his age he is wise,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Don't put yourself over the line,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Every brain is civilized,
Circled by the circus sands,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
He's the property of Jesus,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
By rivers of blindness,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
People carry roses,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
I like the way that you move your hips,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Where life and death are memorized,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Don't let her see,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
God knows it's true,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Watch the river flow,
Mixing up the medicine,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
And give him back the time he's done,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
In the end,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
You got something better,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Ooh, watered-down love,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
I threw it all away,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Or select you or dissect you,
I want my arms around you,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Going, going, gone,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
As human gods aim for their mark,
You don't want a love that's pure,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
My hands can't feel to grip,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
And I'm just like that bird,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
When you think that you've lost everything,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
To be––direction home,
Private reasons, great or small,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
She got great big hind legs,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
They say every man must fall,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Well, there ain't no going back,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Trouble,
That must be what it's all about,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
When there is no more,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Not the end, not the end,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
You were snow, you were rain,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
See you fly or watch you die,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
They say everything can be replaced,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
But, if I can save you any time,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Wintertime in New York town,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Well, I can't understand,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Something about you that I can't shake,
One by one they followed the sun,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
They say every distance is not near,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Had a dream about you, baby,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I got no place left to turn,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
That the laws are with him,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Babe, come crawl out your window,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Drag you down or drain you down,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
If I didn't have to guess,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
The man there said he loved my sound,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
In love and with kindness,
God knows it's outta sight,
In the hills of mystery,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
With his fist in a clinch,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
To be on your own,
Without ideals or violence,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
In the image of someone you used to know,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Tell her not to worry,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
They––they show me to the door,
That fired the gun,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Ah, get sick, get well,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
First degree and second degree,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
From their fates try to resign,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
And here I sit so patiently,
And also by his feet,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
How he died nobody can say,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
I been good while I been waiting,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
You can raise up your right hand,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
They run a brick and tile company,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Get jailed, jump bail,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Went to the station down in the yard,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
I went down to scrub and rub,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Makes no difference where she's been,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Far away and over the wall,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Just as long as you stay with me,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
All that and more and then some,
Father of black, father of white,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Want you so bad,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
It was a girl I learned it from,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Looking for a new fool,
Three angels up above the street,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
In the darkness of my night,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
To gather flowers constantly,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
I been riding the midnight train,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Too serious to fool,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
You want watered-down love,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Go down to the river, babe,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Get back, write Braille,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
It was from her ship sailing,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
He's not selling any alibis,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
We never much thought we could get very old,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
You don't have to feed me,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Yesterday is just a memory,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Went back home to the yard,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
So glad,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
And you make love just like a woman,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
You even make love just like a woman,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
When the night comes falling,
To find out if she's talked,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
To be so useless and all,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Watch the plain-clothes,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
And come every time you call,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
It always means so much,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
For she ain't the same,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
You have given everything to me,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
And it's like I ain't here,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
The night would see me wide awake,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Blowing like she never blowed before,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
And may you stay forever young,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Love that's pure no accident,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Automobile coming into style,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
People talk of situations,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
But I'm saved,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
God don't call it wrong,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
With no direction home,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
I'll go see them come down my way,
I'm never, never far from home,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Come all without, come all within,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
You have given me eyes to see,
They say every man needs protection,
Advertising signs, they con,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
And I'm in the shade,
Icicles hanging down,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Serve somebody,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
And pretend that we never have touched,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
China doll, alcohol,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
I just can't beg you anymore,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Stay away from the train line,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Thinking about the government,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
While riding on a train going west,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Vanished from my hand,
I can't be good, baby,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Searching everywhere I know,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Got my mind made up,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
And to come every time you call,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
That they do not respect in any degree,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Well, I been gambling so long,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Like you never did before,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
My arms and legs were broken,
Socialism, hypnotism,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Roll, Willie, roll,
May you stay forever young,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Like as not, it's better so,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
In the great unknown,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Just like I did before,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I'd be sad and blue,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
That foreign sound in your ear,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I went out last night to take a little round,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
God sees it all unfold,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Far past the frozen leaves,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Just don't know what to do,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Like some mystery,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
And the point is slick,
Out to the windy beach,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I'm leaving today,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
My senses have been stripped,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
People talk over situations,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
That her father was going to hang,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Well, get sick, get well,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Tell me,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
The air is getting hotter,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Father of time and father of dreams,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Six months on the chain gang,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I had so much left to do,
Dust on my face and my cape,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Don't ever try to change me,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Aim well, my little one,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Where the neon madmen climb,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
And played the fife lowly,
God knows it's a struggle,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Don't mind the driving rain,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
And not going through any great extreme,
Give you my money, honey,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
A complete unknown,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
I've been all around the world, boys,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Oh, in somebody's room,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
I'd give you the sky high above,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Into my own parade,
Too noble to neglect,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
If not for you,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Corrina, Corrina,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
But, deep inside my heart,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Is used, it is plain,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
In another I witnessed a crime,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
The joint is jumping,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
A dream about you, baby,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
To be out on your own,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
They lowered him down as a king,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Honey, just for you to climb,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
It hurts me, too,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Relationships of ownership,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
By users, cheaters,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
And to come each time you call,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Don't wear sandals,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Need a woman all the time,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
My woman's never sitting at home,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
You have explained every mystery,
How he died nobody could say,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Dream about you, baby,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
You can run down to the desert,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
But you try with your whole soul,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I tried to reach you, honey,
The country doctor rambles,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
For the wise men and the fools,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Yes, and I'll go last,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
A hand set the spark,
Make you spin or do you in,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
I had no one for to go my bail,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Holding his club like he was a king,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Under the microscope,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
To your tambourine in time,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Till both of us fell by the way,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Father who build the mountain so high,
He's young and on fire,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You and me, we had completeness,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Friends with you,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
And it ain't me, babe,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
And, if anybody asks me,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
They walk among the stately trees,
You can hear them tires squeal,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
But something has changed,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
She said she would always stay,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
No, nothing was delivered,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
You will be alright, girl,
They say every man need protection,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Get born, keep warm,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
We live and we die, we know not why,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
It's a price I have to pay,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Oh, see what you can do,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Try to be a success,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
I got a bird that whistles,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
One by one until there were none,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
It don't matter what you did,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
As the present now will later be past,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
You wanna drown love,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Watered-down love,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Yet every distance is not near,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Don't follow leaders,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Well, I don't mind dying,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
And it's only that I'm asking,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
We'll fly the night away,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
She said she would never forget,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
I got the worried blues,
But ye shall be a-changed,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
As his youth now unfolds,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
But he can't be blamed,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
I love you, pretty baby,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Equality, liberty,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Waiting for the trains,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Go away from my window,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Is looking for a new fool,
Well, well, well,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Don't let her see where you're going,
One more night the stars are in sight,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
I don't wanna fake you out,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
And forget my pride,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Who will promise never to part,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Tell me that you love me only,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Don't let her know,
He been around the world and back again,
Well, I'm pressing on,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
The train leaves at half past ten,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Don't steal, don't lift,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Just then the order came to charge,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I would not feel so all alone,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
By losers, cheaters,
Without a dream in my heart,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Using every angle under the sun,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
To know how much I really care,
I shall be released,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Forever young, forever young,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
A million faces at my feet,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Don't let her know that you love her,
God knows it's terrifying,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Can't find what I need,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
May be an actor in a plot,
We live in a political world,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
A foreign sound to your ear,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Pressing on,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
If ever I prove false to you,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
May be living in another country under another name,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Read books and repeat quotations,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
You follow, find yourself at war,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Honey, I will meet you there,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Stripping away at it all,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Seven days,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Carry the New York Times,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Well, the job that you used to have,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
That fellow who never blushes,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Never needed to call you my whore,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Giving back all of what you owe,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
It always has hit me from below,
She'll surely turn to white,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
To hang and to lynch,
Some things are too hot to touch,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
To protect his white skin,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
The beat is pumping,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
With the juice running down my leg,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
So, never leave me lonely,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
And point away from the past,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
To stay closer than any friend,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
The winter would hold no spring,
You'll change your last name, too,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
That long, black train is pulling down,
You've got to serve somebody,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Winter would have no spring,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
So many roads, so much at stake,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
A true love of mine,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
God knows everything,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
We take great delight in our own company,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
My love, she speaks like silence,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
In his anger and his shame,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Don't let me drift too far,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Don't try No Doz,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
But, if I will save you the time,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I think we better talk this over,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Someone to close his heart,
And comes to a permanent stop,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
To have––be on your own,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Oh, Angelina,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Going home,
Memory, ecstasy,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
On this new morning, new morning,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
People going down to the ground,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Bring the wife and family,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Newspapermen eating candy,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
I went into the city, into the town,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
How does it feel,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I got two white horses following me,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Far away from it all,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Badge out, laid off,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
I try my best to be like I am,
Looking 'bout the government,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
I got my mind made up,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Had no one to go my bail,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
When God and man will be reconciled,
In the instant that I preach,
A man with a badge skips by,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
They tell me every man must fall,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
They pass by so silently,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Courage is a thing of the past,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
In the lonely night,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Thank You, Lord,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
You're beautiful to me,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Well, I'm so glad,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Eh, singing just for you,
And, although that we're single and free,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
My woman needs it every day,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Oh, singing just for you,
Precious memories, how they linger,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Nothing was delivered,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Don't matter what you did,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
To be without a home,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
At the close of the day,
To be one your own,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
And your streets are getting empty,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
God knows there's a purpose,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
I need a shot of love,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Silvio, I gotta go,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Face full of black soot,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Eh, see what you can do,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
That can do what's never been done,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Far away in the stormy night,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
All you can do is do what you must,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Go melt back in the night,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
God knows how to make it flow,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I'd only have to stay,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Loneliness, tenderness,
"Not me," said his manager,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Rabbit running down across the road,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
You got to serve somebody,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
I don't care if you feel like me,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Just like a rolling stone,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
He won't do nothing to you,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
A question in your nerves is lit,
He is centuries old,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
You need something to open up a new door,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
And I'm so glad,
She once was a true love of mine,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
They keep it all hid,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
My limbs are shaking,
You gotta look some other place,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Laying low,
On the stone that remains,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
You always responded when I needed your help,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
At ships with tattooed sails,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Don't tie no bows,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Read books, repeat quotations,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Why she did go,
Broken threads, broken springs,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
I know I can't win,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
When all will be well,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Without a love of my own,
I found my world, found my world in you,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Simplify you, classify you,
True love of mine,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Day you quit me, baby,
I thank the Lord,
Said I'm pressing on,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I try my best to be just like I am,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
But I know that he don't talk,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
And she aches just like a woman,
I can make it through,
Keep a clean nose,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
I'm going down the river,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
I want you so bad,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
I just keep pressing on,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
There she come, now, down my way,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
You stole her love from me one day,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Don't know what to do without it,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Strangers all give me the news,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
But you were gambling for support,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
This world is ruled by violence,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
I'm going out of my mind,
Stone you and say good luck,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
It's not aimed at anyone,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Baby, please stop crying,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
For the politician's gain,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
"Come along and take a trip,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
To a solid rock,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
And I'm back in the rain,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
No direction home,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
I should have left this town this morning,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
You'll be doing society a favor,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
You could look at it and weep,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
They don't believe in mercy,
Look away, you rolling river,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
God knows it's a crime,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Going,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
She's the worst you could ever have,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
For her to arrive,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
True love, they've been without it,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Joey, Joey,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Made before the foundation of the world,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
And the sooner you come up with them,
It's too bad he had to go,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Silhouetted by the sea,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
King of the streets, child of clay,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I rambled out of New York town,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Staying far behind without you,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Mercury, gravity,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
She leave by the other and roam,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
One summer's day he came passing by,
To hide 'neath a hood,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Try hard, get barred,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
They say that every man must fall,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
I can change, I swear,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
God knows there's a chance,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
A thousand miles from home,
Like a complete unknown,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
And gathering storms may arise,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
I been good,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
And on the highway of regret,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
So I got those worries blues,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
This situation can only get rougher,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I once held her in my arms,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
But I'm pressing on,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
The light I never knowed,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
People are crazy, times are strange,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Going, going,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Saved,
And I got the worried blues,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Don't let yourself stumble,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
You have given me life to live,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
And, though the line is cut,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Stone you when you are young and able,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
It's rising up above my head,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Up and down the block,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
All them prophets good and gone,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
My hands didn't touch him none,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Light yourself a candle,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
I long to see you in the morning light,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Without your sweet love,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I went back home, put on my tie,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Over your senses you have no control,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
This place ain't doing me any good,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
And she makes love just like a woman,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
If you throw it all away,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
And I got those worried blues,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Each one playing a horn,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
For something that he never done,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
We've killed each one,
Oh, watered-down love,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
It was you who came right through,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Better jump down the manhole,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Of this I can't say very much,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
The kingdoms of experience,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Father of air and father of trees,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
In one the surface was frozen,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
God knows you've got to weep,
If anything is gonna sell,
Since you've been gone,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
One by one they follow the sun,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
They must bust in early May,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
You were striped, you were plain,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I have no one to meet,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Grandpa died last week,
I can see the turning of the key,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
I'll be on my way,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Hang around the ink-well,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
The day you quit me, baby,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
God knows it's fragile,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Fare thee well but for a while,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
You say my kisses are not like his,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Look out, kid,
I just don't know what to do,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
But it ain't me, babe,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Gonna serve somebody,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Nothing too very scientific,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Two by two they step in the dark,
I'm so glad,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
My existence led by confusion boats,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
I like the cool way you look at me,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Made of silver or of golden,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
The wind howls like a hammer,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Is it really any wonder,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Like a rolling stone,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
But I've been hanging on,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
I don't care if you analyze me,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
It's alright,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
If you'd see me this way,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Don't let her hear,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
As the daylight hours do increase,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Ain't no going back,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Like a dog on a chain,
You better chew gum,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
The night passed away so quickly,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
New morning,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Want you,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
I went into the red, went into the black,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Don't you tell Henry,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Four by four, no illusion for,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
The one we can see and can feel,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
God knows there's a river,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Madams light the candles,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
She'll be coming forth,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Loyalty, unity,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
May be the head of some big TV network,
So unknown,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
To keep up his hate,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Speaking to some French girl,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
God knows that, when you see it,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
I can't cross the line, you know,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
I got a wife and five little children,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
I went down where the vultures feed,
When she lays upon the grass,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Look who's back in town,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
And she'll be coming forth,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
"Not I," said the referee,
I had a dream about you, baby,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Precious father, loving mother,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
I wish I a-was a magician,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
More people kept a-piling on,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
My dear, sweet friend,
The only son of God Almighty,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
If you must cling to someone,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
She never does me wrong,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I wish tonight were here,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
She's opened up a happy home,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Of ancient history,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
But it would not be new,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And the whole world is on your case,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
And all of your children start to resent you,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
To strict party-platform ties,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
And you know I could never be your own,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
And, if I see the day,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Ye shall be changed,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
The country music station plays soft,
Searching high, searching low,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
She would have married me,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
I run right home and I went to bed,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Better jump down a manhole,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
The Second World War came to an end,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Father of day, father of night,
Trust yourself,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
When I was in Missouri,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
When I seen him lose control,
But evidently she don't,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
He got that soft, silky skin,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
They say every man must need protection,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
It's really something,
I never can go because, you know,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Thieving in the alley,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
God knows when,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
But, to remain as friends,
Give what I got until I got no more,
And furnish me with tape,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Precious angel under the sun,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
The day would surely have to break,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
You need something to open your eyes,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
I've been around this whole country,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Someone to open each and every door,
Stand up straight and tall,
And there's two white horses following me,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
I bless the day I found you,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I got those worried blues,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Broken hands on broken plows,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
The midnight rain follows the train,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
God knows there's a heaven,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Keep me where you are,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Watching the river flow,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Got me a secret membership card,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
I won't have my nature way,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
If'n you don't know by now,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Never weak, but always strong,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
And ride a horse along the trail,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Heart of mine, be still,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Every head is so dignified,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Love don't have any place,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Cares not to come up any higher,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
You had enough of hatred,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
With a killer's pride, security,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
It's like I ain't here,
Who could they get to carry you,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Father of minutes, father of days,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Three by three they're turning the key,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Tears on the letter that I write,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Over the hills and far away,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
It still ain't me, babe,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Eh, in somebody's room,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
You to me were true,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Drifting too far from shore,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
The man in the trench-coat,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
My love, she speaks softly,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
In the turning of twilight,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
But, if you want me to,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
But the time ain't tall,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Resent him to the bone,
And, if I can save you any time,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Each time we meet, love,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
And every cause that ever I fought,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
All the silver, all the gold,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
There's always someone who understands,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
I can't understand,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Living in the land of Nod,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
But it ain't him to blame,
Front door shut, back door too,
You made it there somehow,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Where I will always be renewed,
First to come in was the flying moth,
For all intended purposes,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
But you're doing it again,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
All I really wanna do,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Democracy don't rule the world --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
That's where you belong --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
I'll remember you.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Everybody that was hanging out.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
That Johanna's not here.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
If you throw it all away.
I seen a man.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Some speak of the future.
They both rode off together.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
My love winks, she does not bother.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
After losing every battle.
I never saw the man again.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
I once held her in my arms.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Where teardrops fall.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Know not what the years may hold.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
In the border-towns of despair.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.

Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Blues wrapped around my head.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.

Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.

Love my Blackjack Davey.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
In my Cadillac.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
Need that woman straight and true.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".

Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.

I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".

Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Broken voices on broken phones.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
I'd be lost if not for you.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.

There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Memories of what used to be.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
With all these promises you left for me.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.

Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Got my mind made up.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.

He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Tumbled all down into pieces.

And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
That's the way I remember her best.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Her fond face pale with woe.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.

Can't see over to the other side.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.

As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.

You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Crying out that he was framed.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
His mama sure was proud of him.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
I just go pump on it some.
Valentines can't buy her.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
If you just let me come home with you.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Under the midnight moon.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
Kisses she gave him three.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
And no time to think.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
You don't have to worry any more.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Going, going, gone.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Rain would gather, too.
Tell me that it isn't true.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.

She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
Until my dying-day.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
I got nothing left to burn.
Reality has always had too many heads.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
You're my baby.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Who always was too proud to beg.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.

While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
That old ship was a-going down.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
I want everybody to be free.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
And every window made of glass.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
On this new morning with you.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
To the old folks' home and the college.
Blood on your saddle.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
You can make it too.
Figuring a way to get back home.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
But I was raised on the other.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
And crime don't have a face.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
And ye shall be changed.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
I can't fight them anymore.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
And wait for succeeding kings.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
And then go on home and have my fun.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
You're on the bottom.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Fear to bring children into the world.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Lord, protect my child.
Bid farewell forever.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Baby, baby.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
But she had some way of finding them out.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Ever since I seen you there.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Father of love and father of rain.
Unless they're from another world.
Well, I'm just thumping.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
I scarcely feel the glow.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.

To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
And try to avoid the scandals.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
I'm sad and lonely too.
I'm a poet, I know it.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
And watch the parking meters.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Mortality, reality.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
And keep away from pranks.
For the times, they are a-changing.
By the jealousy of others around her.

'Bout the shape that he's in.

At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.

So the radio didn't work so well.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
At not getting their money's worth.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
The light I never knowed.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.

We got met with a tear gas bomb.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
I'm just like him, the same as you.

They found him dead in the street one day.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
My mind is breaking.

I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
And one day he came passing by.
Finalize you or advertise you.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
That must be what it's all about.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Under the hedges.
That last night I was with.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
That just struck me kinda funny.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.

Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
That set everybody free.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.

But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
To know which way the wind blows.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.

But he sure left here in style.
Just like so many times before.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.

I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
She saw her father's body broken.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.

They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.

You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
Suffering like a fool.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.

Some kinda things you can never kill.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.

For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Mine alone.

Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
And clouds cover up the ground.
You break your promise all over the place.
But you're not even sure what it is.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Baby, please come home.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.

You're very well-read, it's well-known.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
There was nobody around.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
It hurts me, too.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
It was all over by a quarter past.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
"And stay all night with me.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
When I've forgotten all the rest.

Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.

I hope you're ready.
It'll never do, somehow.
With the glory that is to be.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Some place so high above this wall.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
They want me for a gambling fight.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
My baby told me I would have to go.

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
But my heart just won't give in.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
I would only let you down.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
And shot it fulla holes.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
And I've never been too impressed.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Nobody stops to ask why.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Ever since I seen her smile.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
When she's better only time'll tell.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
I'm going where I never been before.
To live it you had to explode.
And tapestry of rhyme.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
And all I see are dark eyes.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
You can't win with a losing hand.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
I hope I'm ready.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
And all your raging glory.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
We were the wrong side.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
I did not do it knowingly.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Than people who are most content.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
It don't matter anyhow.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
They would not let me be.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Step lightly on the ground.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Everything is broken.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
My face you'll never see no more.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Just to take somebody's money away.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Without a love of my own.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
In the palace of the Pope.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Going through all these things twice.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Look a-the other way.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
It always does when you're with me.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
But I ain't neither one.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
But you break just like a little girl.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Duality, mortality.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
When my memory is not so short.
She once was a true love of mine.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
Lost time is not found again.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
I'd like to know.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Orders from the D.A.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
In the night the price was paid.
You're a big girl now.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
68, but says he's 24.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
You're the only love I've ever known.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
And guarded them as they fell.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
You can show me a new place to start.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Some place so high above the wall.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Baby, baby...
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Nobility, humility.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
The next day could be your last.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Patriotism, materialism.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
And your golden loom.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Oh, her darling love she found.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Or put up against the wall.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
It was a normal day.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
You got it, baby.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Life don't mean a thing.
Somebody better investigate soon.
When I paint my masterpiece.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
And they gotta cut something.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Just what he was talking about.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
It's that million dollar bash.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Behind a man's brain.
But the mountains of the past.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
You to me were the best.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Leading me, going home.
And the mailbox is locked.
Without this love that we call ours.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Lay your hand upon my head.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Must be and that is all.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Most of the time.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
If it just don't make me hurts.
I couldn't find any.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Magic in a magical land.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Feel further away than ever before.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
See him at play makes me smile.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
I froze right to the bone.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
I just can't do what I done before.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Ever since we've been apart.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
So I beg you: let it be me.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Funny way to start a picnic.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
And it is time for me to slide.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Someone I really could care for.
I'll only let you down.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Right now I'm having trouble.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Thought I was a communist.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Rain would gather too.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.

Honey, baby.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
When you made everybody pay.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
As the present now will later be past.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Oh, got my mind made up.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.

They call, that simple twist of fate.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
She's in some foreign land.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Headed out for the western skies.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Hmm, tell me.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.

I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Yes, tell me.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.

I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.

Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.

But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.

I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Someone's watching over you.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.

To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Hear me singing through these tears.
He could die happily ever after.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Struck down by the strength of the will.

Love and only love – it can't be denied.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Havanageeluh.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Good as I been to you.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.

Streets up there're lined with gold.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
I'm a-going where I never been before.

To anything I might've tried.

But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
What's real and what is not.

I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
By the saving grace that's over me.

To hold me in your arms.
To be alone with you.

It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Proud 'neath heated brow.

You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.

Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
At my window with a broken wing.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Trying to create a next world war.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.

On the caboose of the train.
Six by six...
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.

He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
I can't hear you anymore.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.

Means another poor boy is underground.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Everything is gonna be alright.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.

About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.

Up and down the lonesome town.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
Evidently she won't.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Oh, convey herself away.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.

Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
A-lord, protect my child.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
When you go your way and I go mine.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
For me to return to or chase.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
But there's one promise, darling:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Till I come into New York town:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
His epitaph plain:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Serve somebody:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
All lies and jest;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Crumble into one another;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
About everybody that was hanging out;
So many things that we never will undo;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Had to be held down by big police;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
I find complete love;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Make promises by the hour;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Some speak of the future;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>What?</i>
<p>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
For all these earthly things?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
What else can a poor boy do?
Why must you always try to make me over?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Just like a rolling stone?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
And one deserving of affection?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Why would I want to take your life?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Too many people have died?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Before you call him a man?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Across the swooping plain?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
What can I give to You?
Where did you hide your halo?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
How much poison did they inhale?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
When did you leave heaven?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
How many more can they afford?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Can you get back in?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
By golly, what more can I say?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
And how does it feel?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Of everything you see?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Before they're allowed to be free?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
The love that a stranger might receive?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Does anyone even try?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
How could they ever mistake you?
Must everybody bow?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Across the swamp of time?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, so why not you and me?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Am I still dreaming yet?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Who killed Davey Moore?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
What good am I?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Who's gonna let it roll?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
What's wrong with you this time?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
How many compared to yesterday?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
How could they let you go?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Is it rolling, Bob?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
How can I live for You?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Gal, where you been so long?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Where did you lose your wings?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
To love and follow His direction?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
How does it feel?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Why and what's the reason for?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
How's everything in heaven?
Before he can hear people cry?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Baby, can't you tell?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Before they're forever banned?
Have they missed you?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Am I ready?
Like a rolling stone?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
But who did I see but the one I love?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
What can I do for You?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
How many more without any reward?
Did you respect me for what I did?
When he's standing in front of you?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Before he can see the sky?
What would life be?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Just what in the world has come over you?
How many paths did they try and fail?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
That too many people have died?
Oh, how could you refuse?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Don't you remember making baby love?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Can I come home with you?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Has anybody seen my love?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
You have to pay to get outta
It was put together down in Argentina
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
They took a clean-cut kid
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I want you, baby, just to understand
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
To see him obviously framed
Now, a very great man once said
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
But something has changed
I still can remember the way that you smiled
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
But she ain't gonna find the road
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And your trouble is you know it too good
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Maybe someday you will understand
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
I live in another world
You used to be so amused
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
"Equality". I spoke the word
For what you sold that's not been received
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
I've been walking around
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
And into the path you are hurled
Roving gambler, he was very bored
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
He was a clean-cut kid
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Many times I've often prayed
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Now you don't act so––so proud
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Then came the warning that was before the flood
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
And that even the nobles get properly handled
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
There ain't nothing in this world
All the sweethearts you can hold
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
And things would be different the next time we wed
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Just what you had in mind
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
She let go of my hand
I'll always thank the Lord
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Silvio, silver and gold
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Now you don't seem so proud
The changes I was going through can't even be used
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Somebody seen him hanging around
While some, on principles baptized
But now something has changed
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
We live in a political world
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And those whom doom and death had spared
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
You try so hard, but you don't understand
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Now, whenever I get up and
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
As I stand upon the sand
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Things would be different the next time we wed
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
And then you told me later as I apologized
It's something you did
You used––be so proud
I run right home and I went to bed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Nothing was delivered
I thought that it was well-understood
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I will not go down under the ground
I had to say something to strike him very weird
So I'll make my stand
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Everything stays down where it's wounded
By no special friend
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
How many times can a man turn his head
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Its iron claws attached
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
You just pick anyone
If dogs run free, why not we
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
The crashing waves roll over me
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
When the roses fade
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
"That I might be gone a long, old time
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
When I'm all alone
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Says it's closing time
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
She plunged him into well water where
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Little did I realize
So I look like a walking mountain range
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Hunger pays a heavy price
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
The cause was there before we came
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
When the rain is blowing in your face
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
See the primitive wallflower freeze
But I can get another one
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Up into some paradise
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Just what you will say when you get home
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
And plenty time for good romance
You could almost think that you're seeing double
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
But the dark does die
Everybody's wearing a disguise
And I ain't complaining none
So I remember every face
I am homeless, come and take me
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
But I can't say I sympathize
A bed that is never mine
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
And never sat once at the head of the table
You're not free to belong to me
At dawn my lover comes to me
I'm ready for to fade
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I rode with him in a taxi once
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Where I could watch her waltz for free
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
If dogs run free, then what must be
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
It'll be with me unto the grave
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
There were times when I was so lonesome
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
And her silver-studded phantom cause
So up she picked her babies three
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
She knows there's no success like failure
Full of hope and desire
As he rises to fame
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I can survive and I can endure
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
"It's only you that he does crave
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Remember me to the one who lives there
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Taking care of somebody nice
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Just pick anyone
You into thinking you're the one
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
They say don't come back no more
So, I called up the operator of time
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Among the lovely people living free
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Knows there's no success like failure
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
All I feel is heat and flame
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
If dogs run free, why not me
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Though its shadow's metal badge
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
You said you'd never compromise
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And I would send a message
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And suddenly there appeared before me
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Lies that life is black-and-white
What good am I then to others and me
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
You say you're looking for someone
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
When Reilly's daughter got a message
From all the plans they do pursue
How many ears must one man have
The man the authorities came to blame
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Remember me to one who lives there
While them that defend what they cannot see
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
And you see why it's so unique to be
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Most of the time I can't even be sure
You know, it's not even safe no more
Breaking hearts up and down the line
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
But I feel nothing for their game
I been wondering all about me
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
I do declare
That she's the same one
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
With all memory and fate
How was I to know you'd be the one
Should I leave them by your gate
Well, it's all new to me
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Limited in sex they dare
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Should I put them by your gate
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And I'm just the same as anyone else
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
We see this empty cage now corrode
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
You smiling through the fence at me
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Better stay away from those
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
From the start by the rule
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Waiting to find out what price
And the Negro's name
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Mona tried to tell me
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
To show you something you seen before
What you're gonna say when you get home
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
He'll see by his grave
To give the special one you seek a chance
You cut to the core
I'm sure you're the one to blame
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
I don't even notice she gone
She been gone
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
What's probably got you baffled more
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
It's all new to me
On the rising curve
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
A girl who would murder her own, true love
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
What about that millionaire
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The battle outside raging
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Early in the morning, early in the morning
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Beyond here lies nothing
The order is a-rapidly fading
The order is rapidly fading
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
For your weary toes to be touching
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
And the cards are no good that you're holding
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Deceived me into thinking
You left me standing in the doorway crying
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
'Cause the battle outside raging
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Where the time and the tempo drag
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Well, I set my monkey on the log
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
If I was with her too long
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
It's not a bad way to make a living
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
But then a whistle will be blowing
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
She rode by night and came by morning
What am I saying? What am I knowing
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
They're drinking up and walking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
There's nothing in here moving
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
I have fallen far beneath
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Look out, the saints are coming through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
You go north and you go south
And how I know I'll make it through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Then she told us how times were tough
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Well, there ain't no going back
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
The man in me will do nearly any task
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
I wish she'd unlock
Make everything from toy guns that spark
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Her voice once and talk
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
But they caught him and they brought him back
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You turn around to take a final peek
Shoot in the back
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Muttering small talk at the wall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
A-how does it feel
And if my love is real
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Soul to soul our shadows roll
All and all can only fall
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
I chased me a woman up the hill
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
As the last fire-truck from hell
But among the dead that were left on the hill
He's sure got a lot of gall
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
A girl by the whirlpool
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Oh, how does it feel
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Ring bell, hard to tell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
They ask me how I feel
Well, if I die on top of the hill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
How does it feel
Ring bar, hard to tell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
How many seas must the white dove sail
Then why don't she tell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
How many seas must a white dove sail
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
He's taught in his school
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Two eyes took the aim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
And remain as I am
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
You better not chew gum
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
But I can hear another drum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
"For you cannot relive them
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
From heights that they could not gain
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
For the loser now will be later to win
All their daughters put me down
And she wakes just like a woman
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Nothing we can call our own
My love, she's like some raven
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
And there's no exit in any direction
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
In ceremonies of the horsemen
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
I don't even care if I ever see her again
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
For the loser now might be later to win
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
How many roads must a man walk down
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And the corner sign
But I swear I see my reflection
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Advertising signs that con
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Guns and clubs followed him down
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Well, you fake just like a woman
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
But the post office has been stolen
You take just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Their religion of the little ten women
And you ache a-just like a woman
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
How can the life of such a man
Must meet the dawn
Why did you trade heaven
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Trying to get a lead on
"Not me," said the gambling man
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And all their daughters put me down
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
A-she takes just like a woman
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
She got such a sweet disposition
And she aches just like a woman
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Out of the shower comes a football man
Darkness at the break of noon
That long, black train is pulling on down
I figure maybe we're even
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Somebody new to beat on
You don't need a weatherman
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Please don't let on that you knew me when
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Uncle Rat went running downtown
She said that all the railroad men
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Yes, and someone must explain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
I'll be waiting at the station
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Have died in battle or in vain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
You need something to make it known
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
And the smell of their roses does not remain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
The ones that jump on the wagon
But it's hard to think on
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
The next morning she had awoken
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
But the second mother was with the seventh son
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
In the pigpen
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
But the second mom was with the seventh son
To remember the times when I was your only man
He got that fortress on the mountain
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
She takes just like a woman
To my knowledge there's just one man
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
But me, I expected it to happen
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
There was little to say, there was no conversation
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Will not be understood as they're spoken
But all their daughters put me down
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Well, I'm hanging on
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Every place I wanna go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
There's nothing you can say or do
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
All I really wanna do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
All I'd like you to do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
There is a place you go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Silvio, I gotta go
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
How many times must a man look up
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
What good am I while you softly weep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Aladdin and his lamp
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Man in the coon-skin cap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
You heard me saying a prayer for
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
I say, "Why you say that for
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
When only you are near
For I am married to a house carpenter
At any moment you could go under
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
For all eternity I think I will remember
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
When you whispered in my ear
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Alone you stand with nobody near
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
Still I say her love-words over
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
In one I was running and in another
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
So, don't fear if you hear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
The lover who has just walked out your door
I could feel a whole lot better
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
And I don't even think about her
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I don't have to go far
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The face of God will appear
But morning is clear
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Who came here from Cuba's door
I close my eyes and I wonder
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
Still I've always kind of missed her
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
She took him by his long, yellow hair
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The wind howls like a hammer
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
All you boys better run for cover
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
My ship is in the harbor
Never no more do I wonder
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
You know that he has no intentions
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
That it's you and no one else that owns
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
To memorizing politics
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
To the cutting of fences
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
They whisper in the wings
And the princess and the prince discuss
We living in times when men commit crimes
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Wants eleven dollar bills
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Good and bad, I define these terms
And your father, to your sister he explains
As friends and other strangers
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
You never turned around to see the frowns
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Thinking of a series of dreams
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Now, you must provide some answers
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
What good am I if I say foolish things
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
At times I think there are no words
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And, though the masters make the rules
Six-time users
You can fall down on your knees
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
How many deaths will it take till he knows
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
People carry roses
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
The cowboy angel rides
Well, the ragman draws circles
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I try to tell it like it is
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
And the poor white remains
I'm gonna let you pass
Romantic facts of musketeers
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
You been hurt so many times
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Six-time losers
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
In the dimestores and bus-stations
With a big bouquet of the roses
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And I try to harmonize with songs
The empty-handed painter from your streets
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Her window's wide open, African trees
I'd gladly confess
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And so Patty calls the cops
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
He's not selling any alibis
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Seven days
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Glide across the lonely years
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And then complains
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
And inside it with the people made of molasses
True love can make a blade of grass
Don't follow leaders
You should be made to wear earphones
Don't wear sandals
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
People on the platforms
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
To sharpen the senses
And tells me of her dreams
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Statues made of matchsticks
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Mama, you know, awaits the news
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
But still remains
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
But, though the masters make the rules
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Girl by the whirlpool's
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
How many years can a mountain exist
She seems too far out
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
He really wasn't where it's at
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
You're gonna get hit
But, if the arrow is straight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
They tell me to be discreet
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
You don't forget
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
I think that it's best
Without any doubt
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
I soon get some rest
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Well, I finally started thinking straight
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Well, early in the morning till late at night
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
The slowest now will later be fast
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Like a corkscrew to my heart
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Our Father would not like the way that you act
You're hearing my heart beat
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
You are there in the flickering light
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
One more night the moon is shining bright
I got into the driver's seat
You used to laugh about
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
It don't take too long to find out
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
And, since my feet are now fast
Wait for the morning light
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
One more night I will wait for the light
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
So he never thinks straight
And the first one now will later be last
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Plants in the bed, but
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
To hold each other tight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
And I, in my armor, turning about
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
How many years can some people exist
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
With your pockets well protected at last
He built a fire on Main Street
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
There's some people that
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Everything is always right
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
That might be all that you got
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Keep me set apart
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
The slow one now will later be fast
They tell me revenge is sweet
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
We can hold up a toast if we meet
In the precious winds they rot
I'm moving after midnight
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Johnny's in the basement
In the stillness of the midnight
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Ain't it hard when you discover that
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Talking that the heat put
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Yet you know there is no answer fit
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
But, then again, there's only one I've met
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
I'm on the pavement
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
By the way, that's a cute hat
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Every new messenger bringing evil report
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Everyone still talks about
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
You used to laugh–make fun about
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To be alone with you
To protect you and defend you
I just might have to come see you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
And I tell this truth to you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I can be just like you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Sooner or later one of us must know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Down every street there's a window
Ring them bells for the chosen few
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He been living there three years now
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
But sooner or later one of us must know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Don't it always a-go to show
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
I'd sure like to know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
It only goes to show
Don't it always go to show
The only one I know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
With only you in view
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Well, I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Yes, I'd sure like to know
She smiles, walks the other way
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
That I was just a puppet in a play
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Or if you just want some company
We banged the drum slowly
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
So they took him to the infirmary
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
She knocked upon it anyway
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Is worth more than I could pay
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
For them that think death's honesty
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Well, I saw it advertised one day
But I can't deny
The Spanish-American War had its day
And for His love they took His life away
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Don't you tell Henry
And the ladies treat me kindly
That I done it the way
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
I send you all my money
How many times must the cannon balls fly
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
I did not do it harmfully
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
The same thing I would want today
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
If I don't take the chance to try
But I wish there was something you would do or say
And it's up to you to say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
For them that think death––death's honesty
To those condemned to act accordingly
Someone to get you flowers constantly
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
My mind weaves a symphony
A cock is crowing far away
Though I'd never say
No, you'll not now or no other day
So I run down most hurriedly
And I'm leaving every day to run away
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Spouted out that liberty
She puts it to me plain as day
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
And that which you've given me today
Maggie says that many say
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
So, I'm walking down your highway
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
But you can never steal away
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And the only tune my guitar could play
Went to the doctor the very next day
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
My ears hear a symphony
For them that must obey authority
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
From phony jealousy
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
It can't be this way everywhere –
How badly they were shocked –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
I hope that you can hear––
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
As suicide remarks are torn –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Havanagee–luh–
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Leave all the children home –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Hava–na–
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Whispering your secret emotion –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
I long to hold you in the night –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
To know where you are –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Disconnect these cables––
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Ha–va–
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
I'm sure it was not three –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
First degree and second degree –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Private reasons – great or small –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Turn, turn, turn again –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
You will not hear a laugh –
Havana–gee–
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I a-hope you can hear––
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Oh, my–
Hang out the whole next day –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Ten thousand miles or more –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Remember me to one who lives there –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Indians camp along her border –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Haven't seen her since that night –
That can win what's a-never been won –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
I got no idea what I want –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
