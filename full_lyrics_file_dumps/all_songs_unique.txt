You make love like a woman – yes, you do!

But come on, baby, I'm your friend!

Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
You must think I'm crazy!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
How they ever flood my soul!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Dignity never been photographed!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I got the freight train blues!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Hootenanny television!
Howdy, East Orange!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Yes, come out your window!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
They was all over!
Oh, yeah!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
They got away!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Yippee!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Goodnight!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!

Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Oh!
So long, New York!
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
You can't blame me at all."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
We want folksingers here."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Where you and I will unite."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
You can't blame us at all."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
That you must always first forgive them."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
So write to her tenderly."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Come flowing down so free?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Will mourn for your return."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
It's all for the love of thee."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
We'll both go home together."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
You must know about my debutante."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
You and I'll never know."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Country'll grow."
And keep him good company."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
I didn't see you around."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
And it's all for the love of thee."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
I'll apply them all to thee."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
He said, "Tell me about it."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I can't find my knees."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
God said, "On Highway 61."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
I would want again tomorrow."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
I'll bring back my lady."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"Have you seen dignity?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Would kill a little bird like me."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Have it on Highway 61."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
I'll endow them onto thee."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Tangled up in blue."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
They look as dark as night."
"That way down Highway 61."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
And have it on Highway 61."
I love far better than thee."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
But we were tangled up in blue."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
And pretend that you never have met."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
And hung on a willow tree."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Get on your horse and ride away."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
But I know what you want."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
And punched my cigarette."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
We'll both go off together."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
They look as white as snow."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Look away, you rolling river,
Oh, watered-down love,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Well, come all without, come all within,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
To hang and to lynch,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
For her to arrive,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Speaking to some French girl,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Light yourself a candle,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
I'd be sad and blue,
Circled by the circus sands,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Made of silver or of golden,
You're beautiful to me,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Far away in the stormy night,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Too noble to neglect,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
For the politician's gain,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
On the stone that remains,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Too serious to fool,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Don't you tell Henry,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
With the juice running down my leg,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Give what I got until I got no more,
And there's two white horses following me,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Precious memories, how they linger,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
And I don't want to drag you down,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Keep me where you are,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Forever young, forever young,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
My woman's never sitting at home,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
I'll go see them come down my way,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
A dream about you, baby,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Father of night, father of day,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
But it ain't me, babe,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Look who's back in town,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
My hands didn't touch him none,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Oh, Angelina,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
And to come every time you call,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
A question in your nerves is lit,
God knows when,
You need something to open your eyes,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Try hard, get barred,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
To know how much I really care,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
When you think that you've lost everything,
By users, cheaters,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
I'm going out of my mind,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Seven days,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Madams light the candles,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
I shall be released,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
It hurts me, too,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
You can run down to the desert,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
God knows it's a struggle,
Saved,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
By losers, cheaters,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Says he's got a bad bill,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Most of the time it's well understood,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Like you never did before,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Looking for a new fool,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
The day would surely have to break,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
The man in the trench-coat,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Using every angle under the sun,
They say that every man must fall,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
People talk over situations,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
May be living in another country under another name,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Strike another match, go start anew,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
My limbs are shaking,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Each time we meet, love,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
They say every man must fall,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Don't tie no bows,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Go away from my window,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
But, if you want me to,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Watered-down love,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
And may you stay forever young,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
I can't be good, baby,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Well, get sick, get well,
Whether you are right or wrong,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
You and me, we had completeness,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Don't put yourself over the line,
For she ain't the same,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
I went into the city, into the town,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Never did feel this way before,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
To hide 'neath a hood,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
To be out on your own,
I once held her in my arms,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
And comes to a permanent stop,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Wintertime in New York town,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Or have done something wrong,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Who will promise never to part,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And the whole world is on your case,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Six months on the chain gang,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
She got great big hind legs,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Looking 'bout the government,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Want you,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
In one the surface was frozen,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Automobile coming into style,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Well, the way I love that woman,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Get dressed, get blessed,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
And gathering storms may arise,
If she ain't feeling well,
Face full of black soot,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
I just say no thanks,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
To a solid rock,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
You better chew gum,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
So I got those worries blues,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
And here I sit so patiently,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
See her in that very tight skirt,
The only son of God Almighty,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
May you stay forever young,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
The wind blowing the snow around,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Thieving in the alley,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
We live in a political world,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Said I'm pressing on,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I want you,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
And I'm in the shade,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Don't let her see that you need her,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Get back, write Braille,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Like a rolling stone,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
People going down to the ground,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Get born, keep warm,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
A hand set the spark,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
It's like I ain't here,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
They say every distance is not near,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
If you can't quit your sinning,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
I'd only have to stay,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Don't let me change my heart,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Walk around with nowhere to go,
True love, they've been without it,
People talk of situations,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
For all intended purposes,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
As the present now will later be past,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Newspapermen eating candy,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
I got no place left to turn,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Made before the foundation of the world,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
This world is ruled by violence,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
That must be what it's all about,
And I got the worried blues,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
You have explained every mystery,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
And, though the line is cut,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Why she did go,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Don't wanna be a bum,
It always has hit me from below,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Gonna serve somebody,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
You need something to open up a new door,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Broken lines, broken strings,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Out to the windy beach,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
God knows it's a crime,
I'm going back to Colorado,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
She would have married me,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
I had a dream about you, baby,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
How many times have you heard someone say,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Going, going,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
You'll be doing society a favor,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Nothing too very scientific,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
A foreign sound to your ear,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Or select you or dissect you,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Alright, I'm so glad,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
And every cause that ever I fought,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
To keep up his hate,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
It's a price I have to pay,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
It don't matter what you did,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
You got to serve somebody,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Trouble,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
You wanna drown love,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
I went back home, put on my tie,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
I thank the Lord,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
The one we can see and can feel,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
And not going through any great extreme,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
They must bust in early May,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
China doll, alcohol,
To protect his white skin,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Friends with you,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
And furnish me with tape,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Without a love of my own,
I'm never, never far from home,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Bringing me all of your charms,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
She's opened up a happy home,
In another I witnessed a crime,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
To shine in through,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
One more cup of coffee for the road,
I have no one to meet,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And to come each time you call,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
All I really wanna do,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
We'll fly the night away,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
That can do what's never been done,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Bring the wife and family,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
You've got to serve somebody,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
It was a girl I learned it from,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
To be without a home,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Stay away from the train line,
Tell me,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
And I'm so glad,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Heart of mine, be still,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
The night would see me wide awake,
Oh, see what you can do,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
And your streets are getting empty,
Who could they get to carry you,
Don't let me drift too far,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
You made it there somehow,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
But you're doing it again,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
It was from her ship sailing,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Is looking for a new fool,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
You got something I want plenty of,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
He's the property of Jesus,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
My hands can't feel to grip,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
But I will be back, I will survive,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
It's rising up above my head,
God knows you ain't pretty,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Honey, just for you to climb,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Read books and repeat quotations,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
If ever I prove false to you,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
You don't have to feed me,
You can raise up your right hand,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
You have given all there is to give,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
She once was a true love of mine,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Eh, see what you can do,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
One by one they follow the sun,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Beyond here lies nothing,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
But I know that he don't talk,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Don't ever try to change me,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
In the image of someone you used to know,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Like a dog on a chain,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
When all will be well,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
We'll go someplace unknown,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
In the turning of twilight,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Never weak, but always strong,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
But, it ain't me, babe,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Nothing was delivered,
I never can go because, you know,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
In the hills of mystery,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
He won't do nothing to you,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
I'll be on my way,
Don't let her see,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
It still ain't me, babe,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Don't let her know that you love her,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
If anything is gonna sell,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And on the highway of regret,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
I don't want to meet your kin,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
To be alone with you,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Going,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
I just keep pressing on,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
They keep it all hid,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Just like a rolling stone,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
"Not I," said the referee,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
God knows it's fragile,
You got something better,
She never does me wrong,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
When I was in Missouri,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Tell her not to worry,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Well, I may just swear,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
To your tambourine in time,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Every brain is civilized,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
To strict party-platform ties,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Watch the river flow,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Don't follow leaders,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Of ancient history,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
I can't understand,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Not the end, not the end,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
I march in the parade of liberty,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
And give him back the time he's done,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Broken switches, broken gates,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
In love and with kindness,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Get jailed, jump bail,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
With no direction home,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Ye shall be a-changed,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
I couldn't see where we were going,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
It was you who came right through,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
The day you quit me, baby,
In the foggy web of destiny,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
But it ain't him to blame,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
That fellow who never blushes,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Every head is so dignified,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
With his fist in a clinch,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
But the bottles are done,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Joey, Joey,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I should have left this town this morning,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
All the silver, all the gold,
If you must cling to someone,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
The sky too is folding over you,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
But it would not be new,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And it ain't me, babe,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Searching high, searching low,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Memory, ecstasy,
But evidently she don't,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
I got a wife and five little children,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
You were striped, you were plain,
It could even be like a myth,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
To be––direction home,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
She'll be coming forth,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
I'd already gone the distance,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
I want my arms around you,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
I'm leaving today,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Searching everywhere I know,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
King of the streets, child of clay,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
And you take just like a woman,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Giving back all of what you owe,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
And joined the John Birch Society,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
The country doctor rambles,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
God knows there's a purpose,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Far away from it all,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
I know I can't win,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Don't let her know,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
God knows there's a heaven,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
I've been all around the world, boys,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
I wish tonight were here,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
How he died nobody can say,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Father who build the mountain so high,
I've been around this whole country,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
And ye shall be a-changed,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
I got the worried blues,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
That her father was going to hang,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
No direction home,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
I been riding the midnight train,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Broken idols, broken heads,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
God sees it all unfold,
She's crying like an evil stone,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
I got a bird that whistles,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
God knows there's a river,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I got two white horses following me,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
In the ruins of your balcony,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Where life and death are memorized,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
One by one they followed the sun,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
But, to remain as friends,
God knows it's terrifying,
And come every time you call,
Thank You, Lord,
One summer's day he came passing by,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Paradise, sacrifice,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Day you quit me, baby,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
There she come, now, down my way,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
They don't believe in mercy,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
But, if I can save you any time,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
For his age he is wise,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
I threw it all away,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Want you so bad,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
"Not me," said his manager,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
I run right home and I went to bed,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
By rivers of blindness,
Need a woman all the time,
If'n you don't know by now,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Staying far behind without you,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
You want watered-down love,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
A true love of mine,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
I been good while I been waiting,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Laying low,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Front door shut, back door too,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
We take great delight in our own company,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Heart of mine,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
My woman needs it every day,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Heart of mine, go back home,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
She leave by the other and roam,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Well, well, well,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
A million faces at my feet,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
With his candle lit into the sun,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Badge out, laid off,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Without a dream in my heart,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
He been around the world and back again,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
You have given me eyes to see,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Well, I can't understand,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
I can finish this alone, honey,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Stripping away at it all,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
We've killed each one,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Don't mind the driving rain,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
You can hear them tires squeal,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
But I'm saved,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Trust yourself,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
You stole her love from me one day,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Stone you and say good luck,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Precious father, loving mother,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
You have given everything to me,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Oh, singing just for you,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Ever since I been a child,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
If today was not a crooked highway,
To have––be on your own,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
He is centuries old,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
So unknown,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
All them prophets good and gone,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Mercury, gravity,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Love that's pure no accident,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Ah, get sick, get well,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Everything's a-hers or his,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
My existence led by confusion boats,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
They––they show me to the door,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Yet every distance is not near,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
As the daylight hours do increase,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
God don't call it wrong,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Precious angel under the sun,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Go melt back in the night,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
You married young just like your ma,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Private reasons, great or small,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
My senses have been stripped,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
I won't have my nature way,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
They say everything can be replaced,
And I got those worried blues,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
They took a clean-cut kid,
It's really something,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
But I'm pressing on,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
I just don't know what to do,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Watching the river flow,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
People carry roses,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
You'll change your last name, too,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
But I've been hanging on,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Since you've been gone,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I get my sweet reward,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Without your sweet love,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Try to be a success,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
The light I never knowed,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
God knows there's a chance,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Oxford Town around the bend,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
The Second World War came to an end,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
God knows that, when you see it,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
You gotta look some other place,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Resent him to the bone,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
My arms and legs were broken,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Over your senses you have no control,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
The kingdoms of experience,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
And they––they look at me and frown,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
They say every man must need protection,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Tell me that you love me only,
On this new morning, new morning,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
While paupers change possessions,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Keep a clean nose,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
All you can do is do what you must,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
And point away from the past,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
I want you so bad,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Don't wear sandals,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
I swung on to my old guitar,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Dream about you, baby,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
God knows you've got to weep,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Like as not, it's better so,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
"Come along and take a trip,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Icicles hanging down,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Four by four, no illusion for,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Ain't no going back,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Of this I can't say very much,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
They lowered him down as a king,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
First degree and second degree,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Don't matter what you did,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
And I––I walk out on my own,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
I'm so glad,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I don't care if you feel like me,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
So many roads, so much at stake,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Going home,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Drag you down or drain you down,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Loyalty, unity,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Stand up straight and tall,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
I can't cross the line, you know,
That two healers cannot heal him,
They tell me every man must fall,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Take the motherless children off the street,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
If you'd see me this way,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
The country music station plays soft,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
She said she would never forget,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Far past the frozen leaves,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
The beat is pumping,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
I rambled out of New York town,
Winter would have no spring,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Just then the order came to charge,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Under the microscope,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Pressing on,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Human gods aim for their mark,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Yes, and I'll go last,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
You will be alright, girl,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Drifting too far from shore,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
I had so much left to do,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
They say every man needs protection,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Name of Martin Luther King,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
More people kept a-piling on,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
In his anger and his shame,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
You could look at it and weep,
No, nothing was delivered,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
For the wise men and the fools,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
And forget my pride,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
New morning,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
From their fates try to resign,
Just don't know what to do,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Just remember that death is not the end,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
You have given me life to live,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
The joint is jumping,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Corrina, Corrina,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
That fired the gun,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Well, the job that you used to have,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Aim well, my little one,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
A worried man with a worried mind,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
With what your fate is going to be,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
And you make love just like a woman,
And, if I can save you any time,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Eh, in somebody's room,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
The angels play on their horns all day,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
You had enough of hatred,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I've been saved – well, alright,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Went back home to the yard,
But I would not feel so all alone,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
It's too bad he had to go,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Advertising signs, they con,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Don't try No Doz,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
How many a year has passed and gone,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Till both of us fell by the way,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
You're beautiful beyond words,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Don't let yourself fall,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Come all without, come all within,
So glad,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
God knows everything,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Yes, I want you so bad,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Better jump down the manhole,
A complete unknown,
My dear, sweet friend,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
I need a shot of love,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Father of day, father of night,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Just like I did before,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Just as long as you stay with me,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Vanished from my hand,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Equality, liberty,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Better jump down a manhole,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
That you'd have liked me to,
And she'll be coming forth,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
I love you, pretty baby,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
But, deep inside my heart,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
It's alright,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
You were snow, you were rain,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
God knows it's outta sight,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
In the shadows of moonlight,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
So, never leave me lonely,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Relationships of ownership,
Give you my money, honey,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
And it still ain't me, babe,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
I went into the red, went into the black,
If you'd see me this a-way,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Up and down the block,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
My love, she speaks softly,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
God don't call it treason,
Hang around the ink-well,
To be so useless and all,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Hazel, you called and I came,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Got me a secret membership card,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
The path you've endured has been rough,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
I try my best to be just like I am,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
I got my mind made up,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Is used, it is plain,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
And the point is slick,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
And, although that we're single and free,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Over the hills and far away,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
The wind howls like a hammer,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Adiós, mi corazón,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
A man with a badge skips by,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
I can see the turning of the key,
And played the fife lowly,
And the sooner you come up with them,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
But you were gambling for support,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Without ideals or violence,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Carved next to his name,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Like a complete unknown,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
How he died nobody could say,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Three angels up above the street,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
This place ain't doing me any good,
I been good,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
If you throw it all away,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
I went down where the vultures feed,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
In the great unknown,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Thinking about the government,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Simplify you, classify you,
Can't find what I need,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
As his youth now unfolds,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Like some mystery,
Well, I'm so glad,
Waiting for the trains,
Judge and jury took their stand,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
The winter would hold no spring,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Never needed to call you my whore,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
You find God in the church of your choice,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
I would not feel so all alone,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
He's not selling any alibis,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
When I seen him lose control,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Father of minutes, father of days,
He's young and on fire,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
In the lonely night,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
I bless the day I found you,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
God knows how to make it flow,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
But, if I will save you the time,
A thousand miles from home,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
She said she would always stay,
You always responded when I needed your help,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
God knows it's true,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
That the laws are with him,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
When she lays upon the grass,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Make you spin or do you in,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Ye shall be changed,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Each one playing a horn,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I went out last night to take a little round,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
When there is no more,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
I try my best to be like I am,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
I can make it through,
Far away and over the wall,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
And she aches just like a woman,
Baby, please stop crying,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Strangers all give me the news,
And also by his feet,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
I think we better talk this over,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
When the night comes falling,
To gather flowers constantly,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Where I will always be renewed,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
The night blows cold and rainy,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Don't steal, don't lift,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
In the instant that I preach,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
One by one until there were none,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Had no one to go my bail,
To be one your own,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Eh, singing just for you,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Into my own parade,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
And think they're fooling you,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Look out, kid,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
It always means so much,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
I can change, I swear,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
But he can't be blamed,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Baby, let me follow you down,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
To be on your own,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And I'm just like that bird,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
To stay closer than any friend,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Someone to close his heart,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
You to me were true,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
If I didn't have to guess,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Carry the New York Times,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Got my mind made up,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Love don't have any place,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
And it's like I ain't here,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Father of time and father of dreams,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
That four ears cannot hear him,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Watch the plain-clothes,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Mixing up the medicine,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
You say my kisses are not like his,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
There's always someone who understands,
But something has changed,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
The sky too is folding under you,
If not for you,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Silvio, I gotta go,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
The night passed away so quickly,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
She's the worst you could ever have,
While riding on a train going west,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
In the darkness of my night,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And you know I could never be your own,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Go down to the river, babe,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
With a killer's pride, security,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
How does it feel,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
You even make love just like a woman,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
But now morning is clear,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
True love of mine,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
To find out if she's talked,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
This situation can only get rougher,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Don't let her hear,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Where the neon madmen climb,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Someone to open each and every door,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Father of air and father of trees,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Serve somebody,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
May be an actor in a plot,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I got those worried blues,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
I found my world, found my world in you,
And, if anybody asks me,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Grandpa died last week,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Don't know what to do without it,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I'm going down the river,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
The train leaves at half past ten,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
And I'm back in the rain,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
I'd give you the sky high above,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
But you try with your whole soul,
For something that he never done,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Don't let her see where you're going,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Some things are too hot to touch,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
They say every man need protection,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Father of black, father of white,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
The air is getting hotter,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
We live and we die, we know not why,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Somewhere down the road some day,
See you fly or watch you die,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Spent my money on you, honey,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
When God and man will be reconciled,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
At the close of the day,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Just to know that you are near,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
In the end,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
And the table's full and overflowed,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
But the time ain't tall,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Three by three they're turning the key,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Going, going, gone,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
And, if I see the day,
Stone you when you are young and able,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,

Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,

A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,

Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
She'll surely turn to white,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Democracy don't rule the world --
That's where you belong --

Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.

The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
I said that.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
But these to tell what's true.
You always got more than enough rope.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
And I need you, ah.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
I needed somebody to talk to.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.

I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
Know not what the years may hold.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
She can't find him anywhere.
You give something up for everything you gain.
I don't know.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
A man named Martin Luther King...
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
It'll never do, somehow.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
As the present now will later be past.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I want everybody to be free.
Soft as music, light as spring.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
A-lord, protect my child.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
"Don't trill no news on me.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.

Who don't how to do you wrong.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
You're a big girl now.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Evidently she won't.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Even the softest touch.
And I've never been too impressed.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Havanageeluh.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
And each one I've never seen again.
If you throw it all away.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
That must be what it's all about.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
Bid farewell forever.
And the mailbox is locked.
And light on your right knee.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.

So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Some place so high above this wall.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
The sooner you can go.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
We all know for sure that it's real.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.

I'd lie in my bed once again.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Lost time is not found again.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Walking around with no one else.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.

The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.

Tell me that it isn't true.
The last radio is playing.
He gone north for a while.
If it just don't make me hurts.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.

Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.

They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
See like me or be like me.
Leading me, going home.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
You break your promise all over the place.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
And ye shall be changed.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.

There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.

She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
I just can't do what I done before.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.

My heart is telling me I love you still.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
If'n you don't know by now.
You only got ten.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.

But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
Far down the street we stray.
And guarded them as they fell.

I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
I couldn't find any.
And he was a friend of mine.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.

Time passes slowly and fades away.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
After losing every battle.
Crying out that he been framed.
To find that the judge had never spoken.

Hear me singing through these tears.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
And I want you to be that woman.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
I can't hear you anymore.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.

'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.

Heading for the gates of Eden.
I seen a man.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.

You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Is what this thing here is for.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Take me as I am or let me go.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.

I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.

And they were both out on Highway 61.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I see that stationmaster too.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Turned on my record player.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
It always does when you're with me.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Nobody stops to ask why.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
If you just let me come home with you.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Try to avoid the scandals.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Orders from the D.A.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Your voice was all that I heard.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
You know the song in my heart.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
That can win what's never been won.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
You're my honey.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
You got a heart of stone.
Hoping you'll come through too.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Until my dying-day.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Feel further away than ever before.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Slowly into autumn.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Carry for you deep down inside.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Behind a man's brain.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Down to New Orleans.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.

Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
He ain't-a got no name.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
To anything I mighta tried.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
I'm going where I never been before.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
But I ain't got Corrina.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Close your eyes, close the door.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Bring that bottle over here.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Precious memories flood my soul.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
Join the army if you fail.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Friends with you.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Just what this song is all about.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Need that woman straight and true.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Under the hedges.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
You can make it too.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
You can say I didn't give to you.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Don't remember one thing more.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
And the Santa Fe.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
I had something to protect.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Gonna serve somebody.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Funny way to start a picnic.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Step lightly on the ground.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
I been worrying about you, baby.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Foundationed deep somehow.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
And the morning will be breaking.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
I just can't keep from crying.
Of every man who put me here.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
I'm younger than that now.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
His mama sure was proud of him.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
That last night I was with.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
May you stay forever young.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Going, going, gone.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Lay dead beside him there.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
From the little Minnesota town.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Sweet lady.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Trust yourself.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Blowing through another no-good town.
The National Guard stands around his door.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
She's in some foreign land.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
And it never seemed strange.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
I'm a poet, I know it.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Rain would gather, too.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Is just equality in school.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
And rivers that ran through every day.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
I can't use it anymore.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
But I never yet found Fennario.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
I can't fight them anymore.
With my suitcase in my hand.
For as long as love will last.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
And one day he came passing by.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
And the night blows rainy.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
Ever since I seen you there.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
68, but says he's 24.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
'Cause I don't think about it.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
At not getting their money's worth.
68, but says she's 24.
That I left in the French Quarter.
It only brings me sorrow.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
At the end of the trail.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
On this new morning with you.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
To the old folks' home and the college.
She said she would always stay.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
And the pearls are from Japan.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Go lightly on the ground.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
I used to care, but things have changed.
"And stay all night with me.
You were always so close and still within reach.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
You're on the bottom.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
But you're never sure why you're here.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Or define you or confine you.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
The hour that the ship comes in.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Without a love of my own.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
But I was raised on the other.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
You cast your spell and I went under.
I had so little time to fail.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Most of the time.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Leave no stone unturned.
I followed the winding stream.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
In the night the price was paid.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
Without ideals or violence.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Someone who will die for you and more.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
As if a wedding vow.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
But the mountains of the past.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
You are on the bottom.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
With all these promises you left for me.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
Until I threw it all away.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.

He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I'll be your baby tonight.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.

I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.

She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Everything looks a little far away to me.

Into the land of the midnight sun.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
In my Cadillac.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
When I'm alone with you.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
I got trouble in my mind.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
You have no idea what you do to me.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
But you were tangled up in blue.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
She once was a true love of mine.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.

Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Using ideas as my maps.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
And that failure's no success at all.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
And crime don't have a face.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
It was all over by a quarter past.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
I find it so difficult to leave.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
I think this time we should escape.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Like you never done before.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
There was nobody around.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
You don't have to be afraid.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
And discovered her invisible self.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
I'd give anything to be with you.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
My face you'll never see no more.
Just like you've always smiled before.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Lay your hand upon my head.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
That linger in the fireball heat.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
I'm just average, common too.
But you're not even sure what it is.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
In the border-towns of despair.
But he sure left here in style.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Where I was born and partly raised.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
An innocent man in a living hell.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Headed out for the western skies.
Come over here from over there, girl.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
If not for you.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
She saw her father's body broken.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
I'm not the one you need.
I got nothing left to burn.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
And your highway's getting filled.
Come on, baby...
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
He never did know what it was all about.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Under the midnight moon.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
It would go up against every rule.

And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
But all I see are dark eyes.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
And I was brought up by my brother.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
And then unto eternity.
I stood wondering which way to go.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
The whole night through.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
And gives it to me for a song.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.

And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.

The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
You'd better get that in your head.

Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
It sure is right on a night like this.
Someone I really could care for.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.

But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.

And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
The man you were loving could never get clean.

You don't have to worry any more.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
To kill with no pain.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.

They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.

And he went and did the Cat instead.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
I know something is changed.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
From my toes up to my ears.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.

Your son is coming back from the war.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.

Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.

You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Going through all these things twice.
There's a guy I gotta see.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.

But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Going back where we come from.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
To live it you had to explode.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Said it was a bad dream.

Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Magic in a magical land.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
If you won't come out your window.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.

We were the wrong side.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
At the sorority sisters' home.

He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.

For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Kisses she gave him three.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
I can't see through it anymore.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.

All my connections too.

At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
And your golden loom.
Adiós, mi corazón.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
But I know that I can't move.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.

Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
To know which way the wind blows.

It's done with a flick of the wrist.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
I never saw the man again.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Oh, her darling love she found.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
I froze right to the bone.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
I know they're not what they seem.
But the fighter still remains.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
By that soft and shining sea.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.

When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Can't see over to the other side.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Duality, mortality.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.

They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Mortality, reality.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Someone's watching over you.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Looking for a new friend.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Crumble into one another.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Oh, convey herself away.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
It's just the same as talking to you.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
I'll hold it down for you.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Remember me to one who lives there.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
And you must realize the danger.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Who says she knows me well.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
So quickly into autumn.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Thought I was a communist.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Blues wrapped around my head.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Everybody that was hanging out.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Now you don't talk so loud.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
For that's the way I remember her best.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Last radio is playing.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
On the caboose of the train.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Living down Sonora way.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
I'd be lost if not for you.
He's the neighborhood bully.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Never been so easy or so slow.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
I hope you're ready.
Hope that it don't sleet.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.

Man is opposed to fair play:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
But there's one promise, darling:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Till I come into New York town:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Yeah, serve somebody:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
His epitaph plain:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Some speak of the future;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
So many things that we never will undo;
All lies and jest;
Make promises by the hour;
I find complete love;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Had to be held down by big police;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Crumble into one another;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<p>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
How's everything in heaven?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Baby, what more can I tell?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Who you thought you were talking to?
And one deserving of affection?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Who killed Davey Moore?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
For all these earthly things?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
How could they let you go?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
The love that a stranger might receive?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Can you get back in?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Are you ready?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
To love and follow His direction?
Must everybody bow?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Why would I want to take your life?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
What's wrong with you this time?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Has anybody seen my love?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
What can I give to You?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
But who did I see but the one I love?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Like a rolling stone?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
How does it feel?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
What can I do for You?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
How many more can they afford?
Before it is washed to the sea?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Where did you hide your halo?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
That too many people have died?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Before he can see the sky?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
How can I live for You?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
I seen better times, but who has not?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What would life be?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Of everything you see?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Can I come home with you?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why and what's the reason for?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Baby, can I come home with you?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Before they're allowed to be free?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Where did you lose your wings?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Gal, where you been so long?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
How many compared to yesterday?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Just what in the world has come over you?
By golly, what more can I say?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Before he can hear people cry?
Baby, can't you tell?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Before they're forever banned?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Before you call him a man?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Have they missed you?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Across the swamp of time?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Across the swooping plain?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Am I ready?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
How much poison did they inhale?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Too many people have died?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
And how does it feel?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Just like a rolling stone?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
What else can a poor boy do?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How could they ever mistake you?
Does he change the course of rivers?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
When did you leave heaven?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
How many more without any reward?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Does anyone even try?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
What good am I?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
When he's standing in front of you?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
You have to pay to get outta
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
All the sweethearts you can hold
There ain't nothing in this world
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
I run right home and I went to bed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Nothing was delivered
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
I've been walking around
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
It's something you did
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Things would be different the next time we wed
Silvio, silver and gold
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
The changes I was going through can't even be used
"Equality". I spoke the word
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
You used––be so proud
Its iron claws attached
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
But something has changed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
They took a clean-cut kid
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
As I stand upon the sand
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Many times I've often prayed
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
How many times can a man turn his head
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Just what you had in mind
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
You try so hard, but you don't understand
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
He wagged his tail and shook his head
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
I thought that it was well-understood
But now something has changed
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And things would be different the next time we wed
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
By no special friend
And your trouble is you know it too good
I had to say something to strike him very weird
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
And those whom doom and death had spared
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
She let go of my hand
Now you don't act so––so proud
I'll always thank the Lord
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
I live in another world
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
You used to be so amused
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I will not go down under the ground
While some, on principles baptized
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
And then you told me later as I apologized
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Now you don't seem so proud
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
For what you sold that's not been received
And into the path you are hurled
Now, a very great man once said
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
To see him obviously framed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Somebody seen him hanging around
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, whenever I get up and
But she ain't gonna find the road
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
So I'll make my stand
I want you, baby, just to understand
We live in a political world
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Maybe someday you will understand
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
He was a clean-cut kid
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Well, it's all new to me
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
"That I might be gone a long, old time
When the roses fade
Should I leave them by your gate
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
They say don't come back no more
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
There were times when I was so lonesome
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
I am homeless, come and take me
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
I'm sure you're the one to blame
I can survive and I can endure
She been gone
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
You said you'd never compromise
Leaving men wholly, totally free
And I would send a message
I don't even notice she gone
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
With all memory and fate
Better stay away from those
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Little did I realize
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
You're not free to belong to me
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
So I remember every face
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
It's getting dark, too dark to see
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
If dogs run free, why not we
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
He'll see by his grave
So I look like a walking mountain range
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
And the Negro's name
Should I put them by your gate
From all the plans they do pursue
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Well, six white horses that you did promise
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Remember me to one who lives there
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
From the start by the rule
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
When the rain is blowing in your face
When I'm all alone
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
I been wondering all about me
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
You cut to the core
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
It'll be with me unto the grave
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
The cause was there before we came
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
So up she picked her babies three
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
And never sat once at the head of the table
Knows there's no success like failure
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Limited in sex they dare
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
See the primitive wallflower freeze
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
That she's the same one
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
A bed that is never mine
But I can get another one
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Why wait any longer for the one you love
And plenty time for good romance
Though its shadow's metal badge
Looking at hands for the lines that were
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
When Reilly's daughter got a message
She knows there's no success like failure
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Just what you will say when you get home
And that is that one must always flush out his house
But I feel nothing for their game
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
I do declare
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
What you're gonna say when you get home
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
You smiling through the fence at me
We see this empty cage now corrode
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
And I ain't complaining none
I rode with him in a taxi once
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
"Oh, father, you will surely die
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
To show you something you seen before
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
You say you're looking for someone
As he rises to fame
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
You into thinking you're the one
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
But I can't say I sympathize
At dawn my lover comes to me
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
You know, it's not even safe no more
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
How was I to know you'd be the one
And suddenly there appeared before me
It's all new to me
Says it's closing time
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Maybe someday you will look back and see
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
On the rising curve
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Waiting to find out what price
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
The man the authorities came to blame
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
You just pick anyone
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
But the dark does die
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
How many ears must one man have
"It's only you that he does crave
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
I'm ready for to fade
And I'm just the same as anyone else
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Mona tried to tell me
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Breaking hearts up and down the line
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
To give the special one you seek a chance
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
She plunged him into well water where
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Among the lovely people living free
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
From the Golden Gate Bridge
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
So, I called up the operator of time
While them that defend what they cannot see
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
What good am I then to others and me
Just pick anyone
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
If dogs run free, why not me
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
And you see why it's so unique to be
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
What's probably got you baffled more
Con you into thinking that you're the one
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
If dogs run free, then what must be
Up into some paradise
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Taking care of somebody nice
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Full of hope and desire
All I feel is heat and flame
What about that millionaire
Where I could watch her waltz for free
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Remember me to the one who lives there
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Lies that life is black-and-white
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Hunger pays a heavy price
The crashing waves roll over me
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
For your weary toes to be a-touching
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
If I was with her too long
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
I know that you know that I know that you show something
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
The order is rapidly fading
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
She rode by night and came by morning
The order is a-rapidly fading
It's not a bad way to make a living
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
For your weary toes to be touching
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
What am I saying? What am I knowing
There's nothing in here moving
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
But then a whistle will be blowing
The battle outside raging
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
'Cause the battle outside raging
Beyond here lies nothing
They're drinking up and walking
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Where the time and the tempo drag
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Deceived me into thinking
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And the cards are no good that you're holding
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Then she told us how times were tough
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And how I know I'll make it through
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I have fallen far beneath
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
I wish she'd unlock
Shoot in the back
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
But they caught him and they brought him back
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Make everything from toy guns that spark
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Well, there ain't no going back
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Her voice once and talk
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
The man in me will do nearly any task
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
You turn around to take a final peek
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Then why don't she tell
How does it feel
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
He's sure got a lot of gall
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
As the last fire-truck from hell
Ring bell, hard to tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
I chased me a woman up the hill
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
And if my love is real
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
A-how does it feel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
They ask me how I feel
Muttering small talk at the wall
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
How many seas must a white dove sail
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
A girl by the whirlpool
He's taught in his school
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Oh, how does it feel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Ring bar, hard to tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
How many seas must the white dove sail
All and all can only fall
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
You better not chew gum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
So, one morning when the sun was warm
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And remain as I am
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Two eyes took the aim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
"For you cannot relive them
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But I can hear another drum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Advertising signs that con
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Guns and clubs followed him down
Nothing we can call our own
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
But it's hard to think on
And she aches just like a woman
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
But the second mother was with the seventh son
My love, she's like some raven
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I'll be waiting at the station
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Somebody new to beat on
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
But the post office has been stolen
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
How many roads must a man walk down
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
All their daughters put me down
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
She got such a sweet disposition
Yes, and someone must explain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
From heights that they could not gain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Why did you trade heaven
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Their religion of the little ten women
The next morning she had awoken
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
For the loser now might be later to win
For the loser now will be later to win
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Please don't let on that you knew me when
"Not me," said the gambling man
There was little to say, there was no conversation
How can the life of such a man
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Well, you fake just like a woman
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And you ache a-just like a woman
As you sit on the box you keep him in
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Have died in battle or in vain
She said that all the railroad men
And there's no exit in any direction
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
You don't need a weatherman
Well, I'm hanging on
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
He got that fortress on the mountain
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
You need something to make it known
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Uncle Rat went running downtown
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
And she wakes just like a woman
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
But the second mom was with the seventh son
To remember the times when I was your only man
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
She takes just like a woman
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
In the pigpen
Trying to get a lead on
As they rode him in custody down to the station
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
And the corner sign
A-she takes just like a woman
But me, I expected it to happen
But all their daughters put me down
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Suicide remarks are torn
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
And all their daughters put me down
In ceremonies of the horsemen
That long, black train is pulling on down
I figure maybe we're even
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
To my knowledge there's just one man
The ones that jump on the wagon
Darkness at the break of noon
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
You take just like a woman
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
But I swear I see my reflection
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
I don't even care if I ever see her again
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Must meet the dawn
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Out of the shower comes a football man
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
That long, black train is pulling down
All I'd like you to do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
There is a place you go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Every place I wanna go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
There's nothing you can say or do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
All I really wanna do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Silvio, I gotta go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
What good am I while you softly weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
How many times must a man look up
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
The man in the coon-skin cap
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Man in the coon-skin cap
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
I walked down there and ended up
Aladdin and his lamp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
I say, "Why you say that for
Still I say her love-words over
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
I could feel a whole lot better
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
But morning is clear
All you boys better run for cover
And I don't even think about her
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
You heard me saying a prayer for
She took him by his long, yellow hair
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
My ship is in the harbor
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
In one I was running and in another
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
I close my eyes and I wonder
Never no more do I wonder
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Who came here from Cuba's door
The wind howls like a hammer
The face of God will appear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Still I've always kind of missed her
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
So, don't fear if you hear
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
When only you are near
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
For all eternity I think I will remember
The lover who has just walked out your door
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
For I am married to a house carpenter
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
When you whispered in my ear
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
At any moment you could go under
I don't have to go far
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Alone you stand with nobody near
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
You never turned around to see the frowns
They whisper in the wings
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Good and bad, I define these terms
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
How many deaths will it take till he knows
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Wants eleven dollar bills
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And the poor white remains
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Seven days
I try to tell it like it is
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
I'd gladly confess
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
That it's you and no one else that owns
To memorizing politics
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
We living in times when men commit crimes
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And the princess and the prince discuss
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
You can fall down on your knees
To sharpen the senses
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
And then complains
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
He's not selling any alibis
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Mama, you know, awaits the news
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
I was thinking of a series of dreams
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
With a big bouquet of the roses
You been hurt so many times
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
And tells me of her dreams
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
I'm gonna let you pass
Girl by the whirlpool's
People on the platforms
Statues made of matchsticks
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Six-time users
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And, though the masters make the rules
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Six-time losers
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
As friends and other strangers
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
What good am I if I say foolish things
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
But, though the masters make the rules
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Her window's wide open, African trees
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
And your father, to your sister he explains
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Romantic facts of musketeers
Glide across the lonely years
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
True love can make a blade of grass
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Don't follow leaders
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
You know that he has no intentions
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And I try to harmonize with songs
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
On the back of the fish truck that loads
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Now, you must provide some answers
And so Patty calls the cops
Thinking of a series of dreams
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Well, the ragman draws circles
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
"Not me," said the man whose fists
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
People carry roses
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
To the cutting of fences
You should be made to wear earphones
The cowboy angel rides
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
At times I think there are no words
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And without further notice asks you how it feels
When your mother sends back all your invitations
But still remains
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
I let it slip gladly to my friends
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Don't wear sandals
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
You are there in the flickering light
In the stillness of the midnight
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
He really wasn't where it's at
Talking that the heat put
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
Keep it in your mind and not forget
One more night I will wait for the light
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
You don't forget
Keep me set apart
It don't take too long to find out
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
That might be all that you got
Everyone still talks about
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
With your pockets well protected at last
They tell me revenge is sweet
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I'm moving after midnight
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And I, in my armor, turning about
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
So he never thinks straight
To keep it in your mind and not forget
The slowest now will later be fast
But, then again, there's only one I've met
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
I got into the driver's seat
How many years can some people exist
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
I think that it's best
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And the first one now will later be last
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
One more night the moon is shining bright
They tell me to be discreet
Everything is always right
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
There's some people that
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Like a corkscrew to my heart
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Plants in the bed, but
To hold each other tight
In the precious winds they rot
Johnny's in the basement
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
By the way, that's a cute hat
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
I'm on the pavement
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Our Father would not like the way that you act
I soon get some rest
And, since my feet are now fast
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You're hearing my heart beat
He built a fire on Main Street
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
How many years can a mountain exist
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
She seems too far out
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Someday, everything is gonna be different
We can hold up a toast if we meet
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Wait for the morning light
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
The slow one now will later be fast
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
You used to laugh about
You used to laugh–make fun about
Every new messenger bringing evil report
You're gonna get hit
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Without any doubt
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Yet you know there is no answer fit
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
But, if the arrow is straight
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
It's just crazy being here with you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
I'll remember you
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
To be alone with you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Yes, I'd sure like to know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Don't it always go to show
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
He been living there three years now
Don't it always a-go to show
Well, I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Down every street there's a window
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Sooner or later one of us must know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
Ring them bells for the chosen few
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
But sooner or later one of us must know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I'd sure like to know
The only one I know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
It only goes to show
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
But you can never steal away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
I did not do it harmfully
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Well, I'm walking down the highway
We banged the drum slowly
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Though I'd never say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Or if you just want some company
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
To those condemned to act accordingly
For them that think death's honesty
Maggie says that many say
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Don't you tell Henry
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
But I wish there was something you would do or say
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
A cock is crowing far away
She knocked upon it anyway
So, I'm walking down your highway
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
If I don't take the chance to try
And it's up to you to say
Well, I saw it advertised one day
I send you all my money
That I was just a puppet in a play
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Spouted out that liberty
So they took him to the infirmary
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
She smiles, walks the other way
My mind weaves a symphony
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
The same thing I would want today
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
She puts it to me plain as day
That I done it the way
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
How many times must the cannon balls fly
No, you'll not now or no other day
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Went to the doctor the very next day
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
But I can't deny
For them that think death––death's honesty
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Is worth more than I could pay
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
My ears hear a symphony
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
From phony jealousy
The Spanish-American War had its day
She starts to speak, but he walks away
So I run down most hurriedly
And that which you've given me today
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
And the only tune my guitar could play
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Someone to get you flowers constantly
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And for His love they took His life away
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
And the ladies treat me kindly
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
For them that must obey authority
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
You will not hear a laugh –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
With notions his canoe was laden –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Oh, my–
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Havanagee–luh–
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
I a-hope you can hear––
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
I hope that you can hear––
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Private reasons – great or small –
I got no idea what I want –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Disconnect these cables––
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Hang out the whole next day –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Leave all the children home –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
First degree and second degree –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
How badly they were shocked –
Ha–va–
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Haven't seen her since that night –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I long to hold you in the night –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Indians camp along her border –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Hava–na–
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
We just wanted to see some sweat –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
I'm sure it was not three –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
With no other choice except but for to go –
It can't be this way everywhere –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Havana–gee–
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Ten thousand miles or more –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Remember me to one who lives there –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
To know where you are –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
That can win what's a-never been won –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
