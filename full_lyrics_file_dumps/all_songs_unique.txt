But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!

Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Get me outta here, my dear man!

He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Oh, no!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!

Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!

My God, they killed Him!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!

You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Betty Ross!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Take me down to California, baby!
Thank you!
I ain't different than anyone!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Looking for my lo and behold!

Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!

Dance!

She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
It was the mailman!
How they ever flood my soul!
They got away!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Goodnight!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I wanna be yours!
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I would want again tomorrow."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Get on your horse and ride away."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
And punched my cigarette."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
And keep him good company."
You can't blame me at all."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
You must know about my debutante."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Will mourn for your return."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Come flowing down so free?"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
He said, "Tell me about it."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
For that reason I will have to stay."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"That way down Highway 61."
You and I'll never know."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
And have it on Highway 61."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
I didn't see you around."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
We'll both go off together."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
God said, "On Highway 61."
That you must always first forgive them."
Would kill a little bird like me."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I love far better than thee."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
And pretend that you never have met."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
"Is it easy to forget?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And hung on a willow tree."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
I'll bring back my lady."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
"Have you seen dignity?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Where you and I will unite."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
But I know what you want."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
So write to her tenderly."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
We want folksingers here."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
We'll both go home together."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
It's all for the love of thee."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Tangled up in blue."
And it's all for the love of thee."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
You can't blame us at all."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
They look as dark as night."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
I'll endow them onto thee."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
I can't find my knees."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
They look as white as snow."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Country'll grow."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Have it on Highway 61."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
I went into the city, into the town,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Yes, I want you so bad,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
I tried to reach you, honey,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
She never does me wrong,
That the laws are with him,
And also by his feet,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
I get my sweet reward,
I went out last night to take a little round,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Searching everywhere I know,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Memory, ecstasy,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Love that's pure no accident,
My arms and legs were broken,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
A million faces at my feet,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Well, I can't understand,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
And she makes love just like a woman,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Too noble to neglect,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
There she come, now, down my way,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Make you spin or do you in,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Made of silver or of golden,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Never weak, but always strong,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Nothing too very scientific,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
God knows there's a river,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
To be––direction home,
My limbs are shaking,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
And not going through any great extreme,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I'd be sad and blue,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Like you never did before,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Analyze you, categorize you,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Eh, in somebody's room,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Simplify you, classify you,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Get born, keep warm,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Go away from my window,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Baby, let me follow you down,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
God knows there's a chance,
And pretend that we never have touched,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
I can change, I swear,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Friends with you,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
They say that every man must fall,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
And I got the worried blues,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
The sky too is folding under you,
You don't have to feed me,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
But I know that he don't talk,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Better jump down the manhole,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
The day you quit me, baby,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Yet every distance is not near,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
As his youth now unfolds,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Going home,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I thank the Lord,
You have given me eyes to see,
I can make it through,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Madams light the candles,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
When God and man will be reconciled,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
You need something to open your eyes,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Well, I'm pressing on,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
By losers, cheaters,
True love, they've been without it,
"Not me," said his manager,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
He got that soft, silky skin,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Bringing me all of your charms,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
I went down to scrub and rub,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
The phone's tapped anyway,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
My love, she speaks like silence,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
If anything is gonna sell,
New morning,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
For something that he never done,
It's a price I have to pay,
Someone to close his heart,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
She would have married me,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Don't you tell Henry,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
But something has changed,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Precious father, loving mother,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Where life and death are memorized,
Don't matter what you did,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
God knows it's a struggle,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
To be alone with you,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
I been good while I been waiting,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
They tell me every man must fall,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
It's like I ain't here,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
May you stay forever young,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Four by four, no illusion for,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Father of cold and father of heat,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
I once held her in my arms,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
The night passed away so quickly,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Go down to the river, babe,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
I try my best to be like I am,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
How he died nobody can say,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
I just keep pressing on,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
I can't understand,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
One more night the stars are in sight,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Is looking for a new fool,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I'd only have to stay,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I can't cross the line, you know,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
With the juice running down my leg,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Father of time and father of dreams,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
In the image of someone you used to know,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Why she did go,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Who will promise never to part,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Can't find what I need,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
God don't call it treason,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
To keep up his hate,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Without a love of my own,
Automobile coming into style,
For she ain't the same,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Using every angle under the sun,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Equality, liberty,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Don't ever try to change me,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
It's too bad he had to go,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
My dear, sweet friend,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Don't try No Doz,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
You have given everything to me,
She once was a true love of mine,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
A true love of mine,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
In the end,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Watch the river flow,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Well, I don't mind dying,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
It always has hit me from below,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Drifting too far from shore,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I've been in and out of happiness,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
I know I can't win,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
For the wise men and the fools,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Couldn't even see the floor,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I just don't know what to do,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Father of air and father of trees,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
But I'm saved,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Serve somebody,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Went to the station down in the yard,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
That long, black train is pulling down,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
For the politician's gain,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
The path you've endured has been rough,
And the whole world is on your case,
And point away from the past,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
You better chew gum,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Yes, and I'll go last,
With a killer's pride, security,
Trust yourself,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
This world is ruled by violence,
I wish I a-was a magician,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
While paupers change possessions,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Stone you and say good luck,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
And it's only that I'm asking,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
You were snow, you were rain,
And, if I see the day,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ye shall be a-changed,
On the stone that remains,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Want you so bad,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
That two healers cannot heal him,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
It was you who came right through,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Speaking to some French girl,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
By users, cheaters,
If not for you,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Don't follow leaders,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I can't be good, baby,
Just like a rolling stone,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
No, nothing was delivered,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
You got something better,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
If you must cling to someone,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I'm going down the river,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Well, I been gambling so long,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
And I got those worried blues,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
God knows there's a heaven,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
My senses have been stripped,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
I had so much left to do,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
But evidently she don't,
It always means so much,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Ain't no going back,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
You have given all there is to give,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
And I'm back in the rain,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
How does it feel,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
To gather flowers constantly,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Never needed to call you my whore,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
To be so useless and all,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
To shine in through,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
They––they show me to the door,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I went into the city, went into the town,
And I'm in the shade,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
All the silver, all the gold,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
That her father was going to hang,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Watching the river flow,
They say every man needs protection,
Well, I may just swear,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
In the darkness of my night,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
The joint is jumping,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
We live in a political world,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Never did feel this way before,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Going,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Thieving in the alley,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Eh, singing just for you,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
I threw it all away,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Tell me,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
And think they're fooling you,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
But it ain't him to blame,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
God knows it's terrifying,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Without a dream in my heart,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
And I know what you're thinking of,
My hands can't feel to grip,
But, if I will save you the time,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
I'll be on my way,
The country music station plays soft,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Come all without, come all within,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
They don't believe in mercy,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Don't tie no bows,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Tell me that you love me only,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
And ye shall be a-changed,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Now you don't talk so loud,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Want you,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
But you were gambling for support,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
In the little church a-this side of town,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
King of the streets, child of clay,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
In the lonely night,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Father of day, father of night,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Three by three they're turning the key,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
To be without a home,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
They keep it all hid,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Tears on the letter that I write,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Loneliness, tenderness,
In a pine box for all eternity,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
But, if you want me to,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
I'm gonna let you pass,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
To protect his white skin,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Carry the New York Times,
Heart of mine,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
"Not I," said the referee,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
God knows that, when you see it,
He's the property of Jesus,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
That fellow who never blushes,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
If I didn't have to guess,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Since you've been gone,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
He's young and on fire,
Advertising signs, they con,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
A foreign sound to your ear,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
You wanna drown love,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
You have given me life to live,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
The only son of God Almighty,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
In his anger and his shame,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Gonna serve somebody,
Don't let her see,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
If you'd see me this way,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Somewhere down the road some day,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
God knows it's a crime,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
If you can't quit your sinning,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Try hard, get barred,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Too serious to fool,
And all of your children start to resent you,
And she aches just like a woman,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Ever since I been a child,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Over the hills and far away,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Don't let her hear,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
I just say no thanks,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Just then the order came to charge,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
She said she would never forget,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I need a shot of love,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
People carry roses,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
When I seen him lose control,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Seven days,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
How many a year has passed and gone,
To be on your own,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
I have no one to meet,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
I'd already gone the distance,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Private reasons, great or small,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Love don't have any place,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
We'll go someplace unknown,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Yesterday is just a memory,
She's crying like an evil stone,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I shall be released,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
But you try with your whole soul,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
It could even be like a myth,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
In the great unknown,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
The sky too is folding over you,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Heart of mine, go back home,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
You got to serve somebody,
Grandpa died last week,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Maybe when we both get sober,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
When she lays upon the grass,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
I just can't beg you anymore,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I couldn't see where we were going,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
And to come each time you call,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
All I really wanna do,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Front door shut, back door too,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
The light I never knowed,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
I can finish this alone, honey,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
But the time ain't tall,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
And gathering storms may arise,
A complete unknown,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Strike another match, go start anew,
I got two white horses following me,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Father of loneliness and pain,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
But, to remain as friends,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
And on the highway of regret,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
And it ain't me, babe,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
And every cause that ever I fought,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
They say every man must fall,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
They took a clean-cut kid,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
That must be what it's all about,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Waiting for the trains,
Joey, Joey,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
You married young just like your ma,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Better jump down a manhole,
Got my mind made up,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You find God in the church of your choice,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Give you my money, honey,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
That one doctor cannot save him,
God knows it's fragile,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Into my own parade,
I think we better talk this over,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
In the turning of twilight,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
They say every distance is not near,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Stone you just like they said they would,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
So I got those worries blues,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Had no one to go my bail,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
And to come every time you call,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
They say every man must need protection,
All you can do is do what you must,
Father of night, father of day,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
A man with a badge skips by,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Precious angel under the sun,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
If you'd see me this a-way,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Says he's got a bad cough,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
They must bust in early May,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Something about you that I can't shake,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
You had enough of hatred,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Oh, Angelina,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Don't wear sandals,
But, if I can save you any time,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Saved,
I got no place left to turn,
Up and down the block,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Don't let her see where you're going,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Oxford Town around the bend,
And ride a horse along the trail,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Someone to open each and every door,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Is it really any wonder,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I got my mind made up,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
I been good,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
And your streets are getting empty,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
I'm going out of my mind,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
And, if I can save you any time,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
As the present now will later be past,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
It's rising up above my head,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Look out, kid,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
The carpet too is moving under you,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
That fired the gun,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
You will be alright, girl,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
The air is getting hotter,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
As human gods aim for their mark,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Resent him to the bone,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
And there's two white horses following me,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
One by one until there were none,
And here I sit so patiently,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Mercury, gravity,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Searching high, searching low,
For all intended purposes,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Light yourself a candle,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Broken threads, broken springs,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Without ideals or violence,
We'll fly the night away,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Went back home to the yard,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Going, going,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
People going down to the ground,
For her to arrive,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Well, there ain't no going back,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Look who's back in town,
Day you quit me, baby,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Like some mystery,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Mixing up the medicine,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
You even make love just like a woman,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Of ancient history,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
To know how much I really care,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
I'm never, never far from home,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Don't let me change my heart,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Like a complete unknown,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Don't wanna be a bum,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Well, well, well,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
And forget my pride,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
A question in your nerves is lit,
I won't have my nature way,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
And it's like I ain't here,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Or select you or dissect you,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Circled by the circus sands,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
It don't matter what you did,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
When I was in Missouri,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Face full of black soot,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
The night would see me wide awake,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You can run down to the desert,
I got the worried blues,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Not the end, not the end,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
In one the surface was frozen,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
And played the fife lowly,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
To stay closer than any friend,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
But you're doing it again,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Said I'm pressing on,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
You stole her love from me one day,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
God knows it's outta sight,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Keep a clean nose,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
You made it there somehow,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
She's opened up a happy home,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Winter would have no spring,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
When you think that you've lost everything,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Over your senses you have no control,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
But, deep inside my heart,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Who could they get to carry you,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
It still ain't me, babe,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Well, I'm so glad,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Socialism, hypnotism,
God knows when,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
A thousand miles from home,
And furnish me with tape,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
The man in the trench-coat,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Like a dog on a chain,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
He been around the world and back again,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Vanished from my hand,
Newspapermen eating candy,
It's not aimed at anyone,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
May be an actor in a plot,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
And the point is slick,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Who among them would try to impress you,
I try my best to be just like I am,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Well, the way I love that woman,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
You were striped, you were plain,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
She got great big hind legs,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
To your tambourine in time,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Judge and jury took their stand,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Keep me where you are,
I don't care if you analyze me,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
To be out on your own,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
You gotta look some other place,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
I rambled out of New York town,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
He is centuries old,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
To a solid rock,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
It was from her ship sailing,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
And you know I could never be your own,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
And you make love just like a woman,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
In the instant that I preach,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
You want watered-down love,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Don't let yourself fall,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
My love, she speaks softly,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Ten thousand men on the move,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Watch the plain-clothes,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
I want you,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
And comes to a permanent stop,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
The kingdoms of experience,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Going, going, gone,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Where mercy walks the plank,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
There's always someone who understands,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
And she'll be coming forth,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Corrina, Corrina,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
More people kept a-piling on,
If you throw it all away,
When there is no more,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Holding his club like he was a king,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
But now morning is clear,
We've killed each one,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Looking 'bout the government,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Hmm, see what you can do,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Far away and over the wall,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
So glad,
God knows it's true,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Honey, just for you to climb,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Stripping away at it all,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
She's the worst you could ever have,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
But it would not be new,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
I want my arms around you,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
When the night comes falling,
He's not selling any alibis,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
But I'm pressing on,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Drag you down or drain you down,
Every brain is civilized,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Oh, see what you can do,
Wintertime in New York town,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
You got something I want plenty of,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
The man there said he loved my sound,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
My woman needs it every day,
You're beautiful beyond words,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
And, if anybody asks me,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Ooh, watered-down love,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
This situation can only get rougher,
The beat is pumping,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Relationships of ownership,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
But the bottles are done,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
You're beautiful to me,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Icicles hanging down,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Already the fiesta has begun,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
I had a dream about you, baby,
With what your fate is going to be,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
And give him back the time he's done,
Tell her not to worry,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
It's alright,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Baby, please stop crying,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
True love of mine,
People talk of situations,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
I'm leaving today,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
The train leaves at half past ten,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Stay away from the train line,
Where I will always be renewed,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Every head is so dignified,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
The day would surely have to break,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Precious memories, how they linger,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
That can do what's never been done,
I would not feel so all alone,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
But he can't be blamed,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
While riding on a train going west,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Bring the wife and family,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Nothing was delivered,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Laying low,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
You have explained every mystery,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
God knows there's a purpose,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
A dream about you, baby,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
From their fates try to resign,
My existence led by confusion boats,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Carved next to his name,
Thinking about the government,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
"Come along and take a trip,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
She'll be coming forth,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
We never much thought we could get very old,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Far away in the stormy night,
Each time we meet, love,
Like as not, it's better so,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
She'll surely turn to white,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
To have––be on your own,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Get dressed, get blessed,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Well, get sick, get well,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
And may you stay forever young,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
She leave by the other and roam,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
You could look at it and weep,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
You've got to serve somebody,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
So, never leave me lonely,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
God knows how to make it flow,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
In love and with kindness,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Yes, I'm so glad,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
They say everything can be replaced,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
If ever I prove false to you,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Human gods aim for their mark,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
They say every man need protection,
I bless the day I found you,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
At the close of the day,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Pressing on,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
I can see the turning of the key,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Hang around the ink-well,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The Second World War came to an end,
Get back, write Braille,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
And I'm so glad,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Need a woman all the time,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Take the motherless children off the street,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I been riding the midnight train,
I've been around this whole country,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
But I've been hanging on,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Ye shall be changed,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Try to be a success,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
You and me, we had completeness,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
But it ain't me, babe,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Stand up straight and tall,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
He won't do nothing to you,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
To hang and to lynch,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
God knows you've got to weep,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Or have done something wrong,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Go melt back in the night,
Look away, you rolling river,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Every nerve is analyzed,
You'll change your last name, too,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Just to know that you are near,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Adiós, mi corazón,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
No direction home,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
You need something to open up a new door,
Like a rolling stone,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
I got those worried blues,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Strangers all give me the news,
See you fly or watch you die,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
God knows you ain't pretty,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Dream about you, baby,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Under the microscope,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Watered-down love,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
By rivers of blindness,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Trouble,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Badge out, laid off,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
That four ears cannot hear him,
May be living in another country under another name,
The one we can see and can feel,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Don't let me drift too far,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
I got a wife and five little children,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
A hand set the spark,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
And I'm just like that bird,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
I'll go see them come down my way,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
To be one your own,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
To strict party-platform ties,
Father of black, father of white,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Of this I can't say very much,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
When all will be well,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
For his age he is wise,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Broken switches, broken gates,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Three angels up above the street,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Five by five they tried to survive,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Without your sweet love,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
One by one they follow the sun,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Heart of mine, be still,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
My woman's never sitting at home,
I never can go because, you know,
Got me a secret membership card,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Looking for a new fool,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Just like I did before,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
One by one they followed the sun,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
You can stick your head in the sand,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
God knows everything,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
God sees it all unfold,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
On this new morning, new morning,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Far away from it all,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
The winter would hold no spring,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Don't let her know,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
We take great delight in our own company,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
And you take just like a woman,
And I––I walk out on my own,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
With no direction home,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
And joined the John Birch Society,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
You can raise up your right hand,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Father of minutes, father of days,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Thank You, Lord,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Is used, it is plain,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Made before the foundation of the world,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
All them prophets good and gone,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
I got a bird that whistles,
And come every time you call,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Oh, watered-down love,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Give what I got until I got no more,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Staying far behind without you,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Don't let yourself stumble,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
It's really something,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
With his fist in a clinch,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
In the hills of mystery,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
People talk over situations,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Loyalty, unity,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Six months on the chain gang,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
They lowered him down as a king,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Every moon is so sanctified,
God don't call it wrong,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Forever young, forever young,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
To find out if she's talked,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
And, though the line is cut,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
China doll, alcohol,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Oh, singing just for you,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
I wish tonight were here,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
If she ain't feeling well,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
I should have left this town this morning,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Eh, see what you can do,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Each one playing a horn,
It hurts me, too,
Out to the windy beach,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
So unknown,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
How he died nobody could say,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Just don't know what to do,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
I want you so bad,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
I'm so glad,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
If'n you don't know by now,
Aim well, my little one,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
She said she would always stay,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
First degree and second degree,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
And, although that we're single and free,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
You to me were true,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
The country doctor rambles,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
That you'd have liked me to,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
That's where you belong --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Democracy don't rule the world --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Honey, baby.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
He could die happily ever after.
Havanageeluh.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
And shot it fulla holes.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Some place so high above the wall.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
When my working day's through.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
There's a guy I gotta see.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
We all know for sure that it's real.
That brave and devoted band.
In the summertime when you were with me.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Greenwich Village.
The same as my father before him.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Life don't mean a thing.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
With the glory that is to be.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
In the dark land of the sun.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
Leading me, going home.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
I froze right to the bone.
I would only let you down.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
She just acts like we never have met.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
You give something up for everything you gain.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Or stay all night with thee.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
A true love of mine.
To know which way the wind blows.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
And get something quick to eat.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
I always thought that he was well.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Tell me.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
Rain would gather, too.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Headed out for the western skies.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Four by four they turn it some more.
I have heard rumors all over town.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
That's the way I remember her best.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Somebody better investigate soon.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
That's really and truly an American.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
What you'll say when you get home.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
That Johanna's not here.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Put me outta doors.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
That I really did try to get close to you.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
You'll do as much for me.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
You always got more than enough rope.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Carry for you deep down inside.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Ever since we've been apart.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Never been so easy or so slow.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
At my window with a broken wing.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
I seen a man.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
I just can't see through it anymore.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Baby, let me follow you down.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
You know the song in my heart.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
It's that million dollar bash.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Duality, mortality.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
From the little Minnesota town.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
My love, she speaks softly.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.

Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Come on, darling.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
You won't get it for money.
"Don't trill no news on me.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
To anything I mighta tried.

And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.

Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Go find out something only dead men know.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Gonna serve somebody.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
But I know that I can't move.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Is just equality in school.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.

The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
Your son is coming back from the war.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
And I's left alone with three children.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
There were six thousand people there.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
I stood wondering which way to go.
By that soft and shining sea.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Oh, convey herself away.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
People bending broken rules.

Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.

And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
He never did know what it was all about.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Yes, and I'll go last.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
So, darling, you better come through.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
The whole night through.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Tangled up in blue.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
All because his face was brown.
Because everybody must get stoned.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
You sound like a hillbilly.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
You can show me a new place to start.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
So long, honey babe.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Billy, you been running for so long.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
I remember her whispering yet.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Join the army if you fail.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Everything inside is made of stone.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Looking for the places only they would know.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
While evening slips away.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Foundationed deep somehow.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
And you must realize the danger.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I threw it all away.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
I never saw the man again.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Figuring a way to get back home.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
If you just let me follow you down.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
I'd like to know.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
On this new morning with you.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Need that woman straight and true.
They want me for a gambling fight.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
See him at play makes me smile.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
That can win what's never been won.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Know not what the years may hold.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Is what this thing here is for.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
That set everybody free.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
She saw her father's body broken.
Drink up your blood like wine.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
To anything I might have tried.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Feel further away than ever before.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Someone I really could care for.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
It don't matter anyhow.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
And I was brought up by my brother.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I hope you're ready.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
Bring that bottle over here.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
That's the day you die.
You can make it too.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Yes, tell me.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
When my memory is not so short.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Hmm.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Of every man who put me here.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
I find it so difficult to leave.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Epitome, rigidity.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
When I run outta things to investigate.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I got a bird that sings.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
Well, I'm just thumping.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Nobody stops to ask why.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
And tapestry of rhyme.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
In fond memory appear.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
But I can't get close to her at all.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
"Don't point your finger at me.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
I said that.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
You may not see me tomorrow.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Throw my ticket out the window.
So the radio didn't work so well.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Hope that it don't sleet.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
Is gonna be against the law.

Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
But I would never do you wrong.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
I just can't do what I done before.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
You to me were the best.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
Never will want for money.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
I see that stationmaster too.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Even before you came in the door.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
To the sin of love's false security.
Someone to open each and every door.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Like you never done before.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
To see what kinda words he could say.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.

Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.

I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Until I threw it all away.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.

Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.

A man named Martin Luther King...
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.

And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
See like me or be like me.

"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.

Right now I'm having trouble.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
But it was more than I could do.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
Magic in a magical land.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Kisses she gave him three.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
Without a love of my own.

But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Just what he was talking about.
All my connections too.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
In an oil refinery.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
I'd give anything to be with you.
I think this time we should escape.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Mortality, reality.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Take me as I am or let me go.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
And light on your right knee.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
And guarded them as they fell.
And I'll rock you too.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
While my conscience explodes.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Than people who are most content.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Orders from the D.A.
To which a scoundrel clings.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Using ideas as my maps.
Have fallen from her curls.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
She murdered mortal he.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
I'm not the one you need.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Even the softest touch.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
The next day could be your last.
From my toes up to my ears.
Lord, protect my child.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Now they say it's the land of money.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
You have no idea what you do to me.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
For she once was a true love of mine.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
Oh, Angelina.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
In the pale moonlight.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
And left me here facing the wall.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
I want you.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
At the sorority sisters' home.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
I can't fire them anymore.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Going through all these things twice.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Blood on your saddle.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
Crumble into one another.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
I couldn't find any.
"And light on my right knee.
And the morning will be breaking.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Rain would gather too.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
He's got his mother's eyes.
Where teardrops fall.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
But you were tangled up in blue.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
At the end of the trail.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I shall be released.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
The words that her lover had said.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
I'm younger than that now.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Behind a man's brain.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Lay dead beside him there.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Find out something only dead men know.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Mama, you are on my mind.
And keep away from pranks.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
It's just the same as talking to you.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Good car to drive, after a war.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
He's the neighborhood bully.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
But my heart just won't give in.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Waiting on my burying ground.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
I need a shot of love.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
And relive my dreams.
That number eleven was closing.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
On the caboose of the train.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
You only got ten.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Under the midnight moon.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Look a-the other way.
"And stay all night with me.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
And discovered her invisible self.
And I've never been too impressed.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
After losing every battle.
Trust yourself.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
As if a wedding vow.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
Some speak of the future.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
It only brings me sorrow.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
But I was raised on the other.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Everything is broken.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Take it on down to give me grow.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Just like so many times before.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
With your golden loom.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.

Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Got my mind made up.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
There's no words that need to be said.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Tried to create a next world war.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
See that my grave is kept clean.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
People sleeping in broken beds.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Broken voices on broken phones.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
I's looking around just to see myself.
Said it was a bad dream.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
A foreign sound to your ear.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Ever since I seen you there.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Most of the time.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
You're my honey.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Madams light the candles.
My mind is breaking.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
And it never seemed strange.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Just remember that death is not the end.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Adiós, mi corazón.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
And crime don't have a face.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Hope you're ready.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Who says she knows me well.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
And I want you to be that woman.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
And I need you, yeah.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
The night will soon be gone.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
May you stay forever young.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
For an instant hand touched hand.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Wants to get it paid off.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Must be and that is all.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
But simply because it's true.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Turned on my record player.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Everything is gonna be alright.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Someone's watching over you.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
He ain't-a got no name.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
His mama sure was proud of him.
But she had some way of finding them out.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
So many people I never saw in my life.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Patriotism, materialism.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
With an iron chain around his neck.
You left me standing out in the cold.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
I can walk anytime around the block.
I can't see through it anymore.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
For the saving grace that's over me.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Where I was born and partly raised.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
I will only let you down.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Got ice water in my veins.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Come on, baby.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
You are on the bottom.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Till your error you clearly learn.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
I can't fight them anymore.
It was all over by a quarter past.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
You're a big girl now.
To see that you're madly in love.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Go lightly on the ground.
I been in this thing too long.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
Trying to create a next world war.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
While the law looks the other way.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
I just can't keep from crying.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Living down Sonora way.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
But the fighter still remains.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
And the night blows rainy.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Just crying out that he was framed.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
I'll hold it down for you.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Man is opposed to fair play:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
His epitaph plain:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
But there's one promise, darling:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Yeah, serve somebody:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Till I come into New York town:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Had to be held down by big police;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
I find complete love;
Make promises by the hour;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
All lies and jest;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Some speak of the future;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Crumble into one another;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<p>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>What?</i>
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
For all these earthly things?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
How many compared to yesterday?
Too many people have died?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
What's wrong with you this time?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
How can you say he will haunt you?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Baby, can I come home with you?
How many more can they afford?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Before he can hear people cry?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Just like a rolling stone?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How much poison did they inhale?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
What else can a poor boy do?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
What good am I?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
When he's standing in front of you?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Gal, where you been so long?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
What would life be?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Can you get back in?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
What can I do for You?
Oh, how could you refuse?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Has anybody seen my love?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Why and what's the reason for?
Before he can see the sky?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
How could they let you go?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
How many more without any reward?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Across the swooping plain?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
By golly, what more can I say?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Am I ready?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Before you call him a man?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Of everything you see?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
How's everything in heaven?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Where did you lose your wings?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
How does it feel?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Am I still dreaming yet?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
The love that a stranger might receive?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Does anyone even try?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Don't you remember making baby love?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Baby, can't you tell?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Across the swamp of time?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
And how does it feel?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Are you ready?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Have they missed you?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
When did you leave heaven?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
That too many people have died?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Why would I want to take your life?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Must everybody bow?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Can I come home with you?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
How could they ever mistake you?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
How many paths did they try and fail?
And one deserving of affection?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Before they're forever banned?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
I seen better times, but who has not?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Like a rolling stone?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Where did you hide your halo?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
To love and follow His direction?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
How can I live for You?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
What can I give to You?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
It was put together down in Argentina
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I will not go down under the ground
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
You used––be so proud
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
And then you told me later as I apologized
All the sweethearts you can hold
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
It's something you did
Just what you had in mind
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
She let go of my hand
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
While some, on principles baptized
And your trouble is you know it too good
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Many times I've often prayed
They took a clean-cut kid
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
I want you, baby, just to understand
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
He was a clean-cut kid
Now you don't act so––so proud
But all that suffering was not to be compared
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Now you don't seem so proud
There ain't nothing in this world
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Nothing was delivered
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
For what you sold that's not been received
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
And things would be different the next time we wed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Now, whenever I get up and
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
I'll always thank the Lord
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Either from the mountains of Madrid
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
I thought that it was well-understood
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
But now something has changed
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Maybe someday you will understand
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
And that even the nobles get properly handled
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Its iron claws attached
I still can remember the way that you smiled
And those whom doom and death had spared
We live in a political world
I run right home and I went to bed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
And into the path you are hurled
I live in another world
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Somebody seen him hanging around
How many times can a man turn his head
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
As I stand upon the sand
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Now, a very great man once said
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
You used to be so amused
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
The changes I was going through can't even be used
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
But something has changed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Standing on the water, casting your bread
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Silvio, silver and gold
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
To see him obviously framed
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
But she ain't gonna find the road
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Things would be different the next time we wed
I've been walking around
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
So I'll make my stand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Everything stays down where it's wounded
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
"Equality". I spoke the word
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
By no special friend
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
And the Negro's name
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
"Oh, father, you will surely die
At dawn my lover comes to me
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
You said you'd never compromise
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
You know, it's not even safe no more
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
I'm ready for to fade
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
And that is that one must always flush out his house
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
It's getting dark, too dark to see
If dogs run free, why not me
Taking care of somebody nice
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
But the dark does die
Breaking hearts up and down the line
On the rising curve
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Just pick anyone
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And plenty time for good romance
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Just what you will say when you get home
How was I to know you'd be the one
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
All I feel is heat and flame
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
While them that defend what they cannot see
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
She plunged him into well water where
What good am I then to others and me
She knows there's no success like failure
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Among the lovely people living free
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
From all the plans they do pursue
As he rises to fame
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Maybe someday you will look back and see
You could almost think that you're seeing double
From the start by the rule
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
You cut to the core
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
If dogs run free, why not we
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
So, I called up the operator of time
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
The man the authorities came to blame
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Hunger pays a heavy price
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Where I could watch her waltz for free
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
They say don't come back no more
It'll be with me unto the grave
What's probably got you baffled more
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Well, it's all new to me
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
See the primitive wallflower freeze
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
That she's the same one
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Waiting to find out what price
From the Golden Gate Bridge
The cause was there before we came
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
And you see why it's so unique to be
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
To show you something you seen before
You're not free to belong to me
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Though its shadow's metal badge
Says it's closing time
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Should I put them by your gate
What about that millionaire
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
How many ears must one man have
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
And never sat once at the head of the table
When Reilly's daughter got a message
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
I rode with him in a taxi once
Remember me to one who lives there
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Why wait any longer for the one you love
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And suddenly there appeared before me
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
What you're gonna say when you get home
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
To give the special one you seek a chance
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
And I would send a message
Full of hope and desire
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
I do declare
Most of the time I can't even be sure
A bed that is never mine
So I remember every face
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
He'll see by his grave
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Limited in sex they dare
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
I been wondering all about me
You say you're looking for someone
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
So up she picked her babies three
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
"That I might be gone a long, old time
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Should I leave them by your gate
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And I ain't complaining none
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
We see this empty cage now corrode
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
But I can't say I sympathize
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
With all memory and fate
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Mona tried to tell me
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
She been gone
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
But I feel nothing for their game
Little did I realize
Remember me to the one who lives there
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
But I can get another one
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
If dogs run free, then what must be
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Knows there's no success like failure
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
When the rain is blowing in your face
So I look like a walking mountain range
Con you into thinking that you're the one
You just pick anyone
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Better stay away from those
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
When the roses fade
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
The crashing waves roll over me
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
"It's only you that he does crave
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
There were times when I was so lonesome
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Lies that life is black-and-white
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
It's all new to me
You into thinking you're the one
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Up into some paradise
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
When I'm all alone
I don't even notice she gone
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
I am homeless, come and take me
I can survive and I can endure
Everybody sees hisself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
The order is a-rapidly fading
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
For your weary toes to be touching
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And the cards are no good that you're holding
It's not a bad way to make a living
For your weary toes to be a-touching
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Well, I set my monkey on the log
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
The order is rapidly fading
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
The battle outside raging
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
They're drinking up and walking
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
'Cause the battle outside raging
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
I know that you know that I know that you show something
If I was with her too long
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
She rode by night and came by morning
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Where the time and the tempo drag
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
There's nothing in here moving
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Deceived me into thinking
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
What am I saying? What am I knowing
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
But then a whistle will be blowing
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I have fallen far beneath
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Then she told us how times were tough
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
And how I know I'll make it through
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
The man in me will do nearly any task
Well, there ain't no going back
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Make everything from toy guns that spark
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
I wish she'd unlock
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Her voice once and talk
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
You turn around to take a final peek
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
But they caught him and they brought him back
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Shoot in the back
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
They ask me how I feel
He's sure got a lot of gall
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
All and all can only fall
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
He's taught in his school
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
How does it feel
Ring bell, hard to tell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
How many seas must the white dove sail
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Oh, how does it feel
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
A girl by the whirlpool
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
But among the dead that were left on the hill
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And if my love is real
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
A-how does it feel
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
How many seas must a white dove sail
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Then why don't she tell
Ring bar, hard to tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Muttering small talk at the wall
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
I chased me a woman up the hill
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
You better not chew gum
But I can hear another drum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
"For you cannot relive them
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
And remain as I am
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Two eyes took the aim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
My love, she's like some raven
Guns and clubs followed him down
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
That long, black train is pulling down
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
I'll be waiting at the station
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
All their daughters put me down
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Have died in battle or in vain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, I'm hanging on
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
To my knowledge there's just one man
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Advertising signs that con
You don't need a weatherman
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Uncle Rat went running downtown
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
How can the life of such a man
Yes, and someone must explain
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
And she aches just like a woman
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
In ceremonies of the horsemen
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
The ones that jump on the wagon
As you sit on the box you keep him in
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And she wakes just like a woman
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
To remember the times when I was your only man
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Out of the shower comes a football man
She takes just like a woman
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Suicide remarks are torn
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
You need something to make it known
She got such a sweet disposition
A-she takes just like a woman
But the second mom was with the seventh son
In the pigpen
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Must meet the dawn
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Their religion of the little ten women
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
For the loser now will be later to win
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
The next morning she had awoken
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
But me, I expected it to happen
I figure maybe we're even
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
But it's hard to think on
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Well, you fake just like a woman
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
But all their daughters put me down
As they rode him in custody down to the station
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
She said that all the railroad men
Will not be understood as they're spoken
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
But the second mother was with the seventh son
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
And you ache a-just like a woman
He got that fortress on the mountain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
From heights that they could not gain
Trying to get a lead on
Darkness at the break of noon
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
You take just like a woman
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
For the loser now might be later to win
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
But I swear I see my reflection
Somebody new to beat on
That long, black train is pulling on down
And there's no exit in any direction
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
But the post office has been stolen
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
And all their daughters put me down
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
And the corner sign
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
How many roads must a man walk down
"Not me," said the gambling man
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Why did you trade heaven
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
There's nothing you can say or do
All I really wanna do
All I'd like you to do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Every place I wanna go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
There is a place you go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Silvio, I gotta go
Man in the coon-skin cap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
What good am I while you softly weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
How many times must a man look up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
The man in the coon-skin cap
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
I walked down there and ended up
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Aladdin and his lamp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
I say, "Why you say that for
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
For all eternity I think I will remember
The wind howls like a hammer
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
When you whispered in my ear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
The lover who has just walked out your door
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
She took him by his long, yellow hair
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Still I've always kind of missed her
You heard me saying a prayer for
And I don't even think about her
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
In one I was running and in another
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
The face of God will appear
I don't have to go far
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
But morning is clear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
At any moment you could go under
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Still I say her love-words over
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
So, don't fear if you hear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
All you boys better run for cover
Who came here from Cuba's door
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
When only you are near
I close my eyes and I wonder
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Never no more do I wonder
I could feel a whole lot better
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
For I am married to a house carpenter
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
When your mother sends back all your invitations
That it's you and no one else that owns
In the dimestores and bus-stations
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
With a fantastic collection of stamps
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
People on the platforms
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Thinking of a series of dreams
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
They whisper in the wings
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
What good am I if I say foolish things
The cowboy angel rides
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Now, you must provide some answers
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
With a big bouquet of the roses
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Girl by the whirlpool's
And the poor white remains
I'd gladly confess
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
You can fall down on your knees
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Romantic facts of musketeers
Statues made of matchsticks
Seven days
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
You never turned around to see the frowns
At times I think there are no words
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Don't follow leaders
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
I try to tell it like it is
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And then complains
I'm gonna let you pass
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
We living in times when men commit crimes
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And the princess and the prince discuss
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
People carry roses
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Her window's wide open, African trees
Six-time losers
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
And inside it with the people made of molasses
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
To sharpen the senses
You should be made to wear earphones
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Glide across the lonely years
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Well, the ragman draws circles
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You been hurt so many times
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
To memorizing politics
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
True love can make a blade of grass
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Wants eleven dollar bills
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
You know that he has no intentions
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Don't wear sandals
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
And your father, to your sister he explains
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
As friends and other strangers
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
But, though the masters make the rules
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Mama, you know, awaits the news
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Six-time users
But still remains
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
And so Patty calls the cops
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And tells me of her dreams
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And, though the masters make the rules
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
To the cutting of fences
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
And I try to harmonize with songs
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Good and bad, I define these terms
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
The empty-handed painter from your streets
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Plants in the bed, but
With your pockets well protected at last
I soon get some rest
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
They tell me revenge is sweet
You're gonna get hit
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
They tell me to be discreet
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Well, I finally started thinking straight
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
There's some people that
Like a corkscrew to my heart
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Someday, everything is gonna be different
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
And, since my feet are now fast
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Every new messenger bringing evil report
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
By the way, that's a cute hat
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Everyone still talks about
Talking that the heat put
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Our Father would not like the way that you act
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
To hold each other tight
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
I'm on the pavement
It don't take too long to find out
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
In the stillness of the midnight
Keep me set apart
One more night the moon is shining bright
I think that it's best
And I, in my armor, turning about
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
You used to laugh–make fun about
You're hearing my heart beat
How many years can a mountain exist
But, if the arrow is straight
The slowest now will later be fast
Everything is always right
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
And the first one now will later be last
You are there in the flickering light
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Johnny's in the basement
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
How many years can some people exist
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
He really wasn't where it's at
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
In the precious winds they rot
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
So he never thinks straight
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
You don't forget
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
He built a fire on Main Street
I got into the driver's seat
You used to laugh about
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
One more night I will wait for the light
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Without any doubt
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
She seems too far out
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
The slow one now will later be fast
That might be all that you got
Wait for the morning light
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
I just might have to come see you
To be alone with you
It's just crazy being here with you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I'll remember you
And I tell this truth to you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Don't it always go to show
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
But sooner or later one of us must know
It only goes to show
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
With only you in view
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always a-go to show
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Sooner or later one of us must know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
He been living there three years now
The only one I know
I'd sure like to know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Well, I'd sure like to know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And that which you've given me today
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
But I can't deny
From phony jealousy
No, you'll not now or no other day
Or if you just want some company
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Well, I saw it advertised one day
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
I did not do it harmfully
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Maggie says that many say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
My ears hear a symphony
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Though I'd never say
Went to the doctor the very next day
I send you all my money
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
So I run down most hurriedly
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
And it's up to you to say
For them that think death's honesty
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
A cock is crowing far away
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
For them that think death––death's honesty
Someone to get you flowers constantly
So they took him to the infirmary
If I don't take the chance to try
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
That I done it the way
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
And for His love they took His life away
But you can never steal away
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
My mind weaves a symphony
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And the only tune my guitar could play
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
But I wish there was something you would do or say
The same thing I would want today
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Well, I'm walking down the highway
For them that must obey authority
Don't you tell Henry
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
To those condemned to act accordingly
And I'm leaving every day to run away
How many times must the cannon balls fly
She knocked upon it anyway
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
The Spanish-American War had its day
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And the ladies treat me kindly
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
So, I'm walking down your highway
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Is worth more than I could pay
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
We banged the drum slowly
Spouted out that liberty
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
She smiles, walks the other way
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
She puts it to me plain as day
That I was just a puppet in a play
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Hava–na–
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
How badly they were shocked –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Indians camp along her border –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Hang out the whole next day –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
I a-hope you can hear––
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
I'm sure it was not three –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Ha–va–
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
That can win what's a-never been won –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
First degree and second degree –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Leave all the children home –
I hope that you can hear––
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Havana–gee–
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Turn, turn, turn again –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
You will not hear a laugh –
To know where you are –
Private reasons – great or small –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Oh, my–
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
With notions his canoe was laden –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Disconnect these cables––
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Havanagee–luh–
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Whispering your secret emotion –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Haven't seen her since that night –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Ten thousand miles or more –
I long to hold you in the night –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
It can't be this way everywhere –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
With no other choice except but for to go –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
I got no idea what I want –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
