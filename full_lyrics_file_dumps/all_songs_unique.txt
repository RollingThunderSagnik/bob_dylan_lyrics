Get me outta here, my dear man!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!

Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!

Goodnight!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!

Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Oh, yeah!

And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Lordy, Lord!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
Woo-hoo!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!

And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!

I ain't different than anyone!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I've got a million friends!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Thank you!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I'll see her soon, I know."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
But I know what you want."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Will mourn for your return."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
We want folksingers here."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And keep him good company."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
I'll bring back my lady."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
They look as dark as night."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
I can't find my knees."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I'll endow them onto thee."
You can't blame me at all."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
God said, "On Highway 61."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Would kill a little bird like me."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
I didn't see you around."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
They look as white as snow."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
And have it on Highway 61."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
We'll both go home together."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
You can't blame us at all."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"That way down Highway 61."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
"Is it easy to forget?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
We'll both go off together."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Get on your horse and ride away."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
I would want again tomorrow."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
You must know about my debutante."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Come flowing down so free?"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
You and I'll never know."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
It's all for the love of thee."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
And punched my cigarette."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I love far better than thee."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Tangled up in blue."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Country'll grow."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
So write to her tenderly."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
And pretend that you never have met."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
That you must always first forgive them."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Have it on Highway 61."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Has kindly assisted me home."
And hung on a willow tree."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Where you and I will unite."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
He said, "Tell me about it."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
(Oh, my goodness!)
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
God knows there's a purpose,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
Or select you or dissect you,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
My arms and legs were broken,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Eh, see what you can do,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
To strict party-platform ties,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
To find out if she's talked,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Speaking to some French girl,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Three angels up above the street,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
I got my mind made up,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Ten thousand men on the move,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
I think we better talk this over,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
I wish I a-was a magician,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Makes no difference where she's been,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
And to come each time you call,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
I got those worried blues,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
That can do what's never been done,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
We never much thought we could get very old,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Into my own parade,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Over your senses you have no control,
Without ideals or violence,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
I had no one for to go my bail,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Equality, liberty,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
He's not selling any alibis,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Well, I'm so glad,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I just keep pressing on,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Beating for the dead that rise,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
They say every man must need protection,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
I run right home and I went to bed,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
God knows it's true,
But now morning is clear,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Better jump down the manhole,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
I went back home, put on my tie,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
But, if I can save you any time,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
She would have married me,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
How he died nobody could say,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
And give him back the time he's done,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
I could have left this town by noon,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Silvio, I gotta go,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
If you must cling to someone,
Holding his club like he was a king,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
The sky too is folding over you,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
People talk over situations,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She's opened up a happy home,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
When I seen him lose control,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
And every cause that ever I fought,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I been good,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
The one we can see and can feel,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I can change, I swear,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
You were striped, you were plain,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
If she ain't feeling well,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
As his youth now unfolds,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Searching high, searching low,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I had so much left to do,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Love don't have any place,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
You'll change your last name, too,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
And I'm in the shade,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
She said she would always stay,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
A dream about you, baby,
It's alright,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Laying low,
How does it feel,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
With a killer's pride, security,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Wintertime in New York town,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
All them prophets good and gone,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
God don't call it treason,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Badge out, laid off,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
A man named Martin Luther King,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
I couldn't see where we were going,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
In the turning of twilight,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Going,
I got two white horses following me,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Yes, I'm so glad,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
So I got those worries blues,
I have no one to meet,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Only one thing I did wrong,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You broke a heart that loved you,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Forever young, forever young,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
To know how much I really care,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
Thank You, Lord,
Don't let her see,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Every head is so dignified,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
I bless the day I found you,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Who among them would try to impress you,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I try my best to be like I am,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
I got the worried blues,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
She said she would never forget,
Maybe when we both get sober,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Stay away from the train line,
We'll fly the night away,
Get dressed, get blessed,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
God knows everything,
I get my sweet reward,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Living in the land of Nod,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Ain't no going back,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Got me a secret membership card,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Try to be a success,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
They say that every man must fall,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Don't let yourself stumble,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
And furnish me with tape,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Well, well, well,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Searching everywhere I know,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
You came down on me like white thunder,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Like a complete unknown,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
First to come in was the flying moth,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
The kingdoms of experience,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
May be living in another country under another name,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
You got something I want plenty of,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
It's too bad he had to go,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Tears on the letter that I write,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
But he's the property of Jesus,
But, if you want me to,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Hang around the ink-well,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
You want watered-down love,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And you know I could never be your own,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
True love, they've been without it,
That fellow who never blushes,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Relationships of ownership,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Well, there ain't no going back,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Tell her not to worry,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Is looking for a new fool,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
I rambled out of New York town,
To gather flowers constantly,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
She'll be coming forth,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
You stole her love from me one day,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Come all without, come all within,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
My woman needs it every day,
The wind blowing the snow around,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Baby, please stop crying,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
To a solid rock,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Better jump down a manhole,
People going down to the ground,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
New morning,
Loyalty, unity,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
And played the fife lowly,
You got something better,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
They took a clean-cut kid,
But you try with your whole soul,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
And the whole world is on your case,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Some things are too hot to touch,
God knows when,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
The human mind can only stand so much,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
All you can do is do what you must,
Like a rolling stone,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
In the great unknown,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
Don't you tell Henry,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
To shine in through,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
I thank the Lord,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
Hold me, baby, be near,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
For something that he never done,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Go melt back in the night,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
To be without a home,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
You follow, find yourself at war,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Heart of mine, be still,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
The midnight rain follows the train,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Watch the plain-clothes,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Can't find what I need,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
That her father was going to hang,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Take the motherless children off the street,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
If you'd see me this a-way,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Father of night, father of day,
This world is ruled by violence,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Far away and over the wall,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Seven days,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
But he can't be blamed,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
But evidently she don't,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
And may you stay forever young,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
I won't have my nature way,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
People talk of situations,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
And pretend that we never have touched,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Ye shall be changed,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
She leave by the other and roam,
I got a bird that whistles,
If I didn't have to guess,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
By users, cheaters,
That foreign sound in your ear,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Don't let her know that you love her,
As I travel down life's pathway,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Nothing was delivered,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
He won't do nothing to you,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
The night would see me wide awake,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Heart of mine,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
If you throw it all away,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
By rivers of blindness,
And it ain't me, babe,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
They say every man must fall,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
On this new morning, new morning,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Thinking about the government,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Who could they get to carry you,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
At ships with tattooed sails,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
My dear, sweet friend,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
They say every man needs protection,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Tell me,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Serve somebody,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
She once was a true love of mine,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
Loneliness, tenderness,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
In the hills of mystery,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
God knows that, when you see it,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I don't care if you analyze me,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Private reasons, great or small,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Gonna serve somebody,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Don't matter what you did,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Oh, see what you can do,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
I never can go because, you know,
For the wise men and the fools,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Madams light the candles,
And I don't want to drag you down,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
They lowered him down as a king,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
You can run down to the desert,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Look away, you rolling river,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
This situation can only get rougher,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
God sees it all unfold,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
And point away from the past,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Went to the station down in the yard,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
And ye shall be a-changed,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Father of air and father of trees,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Not the end, not the end,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Don't put yourself over the line,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Paradise, sacrifice,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
My limbs are shaking,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
But you're doing it again,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
They tell me every man must fall,
Don't let me drift too far,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Oxford Town around the bend,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Father of day, father of night,
And joined the John Birch Society,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
You're beautiful to me,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
You always responded when I needed your help,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Don't let her hear,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Since you've been gone,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Went back home to the yard,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
And come every time you call,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
The day you quit me, baby,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Far away from it all,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
A foreign sound to your ear,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Don't wanna be a bum,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
And, if I can save you any time,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I'd already gone the distance,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
To be one your own,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
How he died nobody can say,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Don't let her know,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
If today was not a crooked highway,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Watching the river flow,
You married young just like your ma,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
In the end,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Bring the wife and family,
Father who build the mountain so high,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
I'm going out of my mind,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
So, never leave me lonely,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
And I'm just like that bird,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
And here I sit so patiently,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
You've got to serve somebody,
He been around the world and back again,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
But, to remain as friends,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
One by one until there were none,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Three by three they're turning the key,
They--they show me to the door,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Winter would have no spring,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Need a woman all the time,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Get back, write Braille,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
A man with a badge skips by,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
To protect his white skin,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
I'm never, never far from home,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And she'll be coming forth,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
One summer's day he came passing by,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
He is centuries old,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
I'd give you the sky high above,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
When the night comes falling,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Already the fiesta has begun,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Give you my money, honey,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
That fired the gun,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
I landed up on the downtown side,
And, although that we're single and free,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
My love, she speaks like silence,
To have--be on your own,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
My hands didn't touch him none,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
They run a brick and tile company,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Where life and death are memorized,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
My senses have been stripped,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Saved,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
But it ain't me, babe,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
In his anger and his shame,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
If your time to you is worth saving,
That must be what it's all about,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Heart of mine, go back home,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
And not going through any great extreme,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
They say everything can be replaced,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
In the instant that I preach,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
In the lonely night,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Staying far behind without you,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Well, I'm pressing on,
We take great delight in our own company,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
She got great big hind legs,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Made of silver or of golden,
High water rising, rising night and day,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
If ever I prove false to you,
But, if I will save you the time,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
I like the way that you move your hips,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Oh, singing just for you,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
"Come along and take a trip,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
But it would not be new,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Something about you that I can't shake,
People carry roses,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Drag you down or drain you down,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
At the close of the day,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Just like a rolling stone,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I been good while I been waiting,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
God knows it's outta sight,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I just can't beg you anymore,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Just don't know what to do,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
I'd only have to stay,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Precious angel under the sun,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
I want you so bad,
With no direction home,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
From their fates try to resign,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
You can hear them tires squeal,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Adios, mi corazon,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
And gathering storms may arise,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
For the politician's gain,
Day you quit me, baby,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
This place ain't doing me any good,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Alright, I'm so glad,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Each one playing a horn,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Like some mystery,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Or have done something wrong,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
You say my kisses are not like his,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
No, nothing was delivered,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
And I--I walk out on my own,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
By the night and been to some place new,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Father of cold and father of heat,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Of ancient history,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I've been saved - well, alright,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
To be on your own,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Ever since I been a child,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Make you spin or do you in,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Carry the New York Times,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
You gotta look some other place,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
So glad,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
That can do what's a-never been done,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
The joint is jumping,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
When you think that you've lost everything,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
But I've been hanging on,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Without a love of my own,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Never weak, but always strong,
They don't believe in mercy,
It always has hit me from below,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Oh, watered-down love,
Yet every distance is not near,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
I got a wife and five little children,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
You even make love just like a woman,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I once held her in my arms,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I would not feel so all alone,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
They keep it all hid,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
The country music station plays soft,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
It's a price I have to pay,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
I've been around this whole country,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
I been riding the midnight train,
Give what I got until I got no more,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Till both of us fell by the way,
You had enough of hatred,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
If'n you don't know by now,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
To stay closer than any friend,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
He's the property of Jesus,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
You wanna drown love,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Stripping away at it all,
You have given everything to me,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Go away from my window,
The Second World War came to an end,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
They pass by so silently,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
One by one they follow the sun,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Whether you are right or wrong,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Going, going,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Look who's back in town,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Out to the windy beach,
Poor boy dressed in black,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Is used, it is plain,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
All I really wanna do,
Corrina, Corrina,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Like a dog on a chain,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
And I got the worried blues,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Well, the way I love that woman,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Don't mind the driving rain,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Someone to close his heart,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Every moon is so sanctified,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Watered-down love,
You need something to open up a new door,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I'm leaving today,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
And there's two white horses following me,
May you stay forever young,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
It's not aimed at anyone,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I shall be released,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
While paupers change possessions,
And she makes love just like a woman,
You have explained every mystery,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
The man in the trench-coat,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
To be--direction home,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Broken lines, broken strings,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
With the juice running down my leg,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
God knows you've got to weep,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
God knows it's terrifying,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
God knows there's a chance,
Had no one to go my bail,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
All that and more and then some,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Well, I don't mind dying,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I went into the city, into the town,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
You will be alright, girl,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Oh, Angelina,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And forget my pride,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
I wish tonight were here,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
In another I witnessed a crime,
There she come, now, down my way,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Aim well, my little one,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Over the hills and far away,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
You don't want a love that's pure,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
To be out on your own,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
All the silver, all the gold,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
First degree and second degree,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
And I know what you're thinking of,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I can't be good, baby,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
And the point is slick,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
On the stone that remains,
See you fly or watch you die,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Is it really any wonder,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
You have given me life to live,
Precious father, loving mother,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
The winter would hold no spring,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Strangers all give me the news,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
That five walls cannot hide him,
In love and with kindness,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Nothing too very scientific,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Thieving in the alley,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Don't try No Doz,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I long to see you in the morning light,
For she ain't the same,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Go down to the river, babe,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
I threw it all away,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
But the time ain't tall,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
The beat is pumping,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You can raise up your right hand,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
And think they're fooling you,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
You got to serve somebody,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
No direction home,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
You and me, we had completeness,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
But something has changed,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
And comes to a permanent stop,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
As the daylight hours do increase,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Just then the order came to charge,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
I love you, pretty baby,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Waiting for the trains,
And I'm back in the rain,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
And she aches just like a woman,
Pick you up every time you fall,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
The light I never knowed,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
It's really something,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
When all will be well,
The sky too is folding under you,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
In the darkness of my night,
Just to know that you are near,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Father of loneliness and pain,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
God knows there's a heaven,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Without a dream in my heart,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
The Communists was a-coming around,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
To your tambourine in time,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Automobile coming into style,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
China doll, alcohol,
Going home,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
I just say no thanks,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
I'm so glad,
When she lays upon the grass,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
A hand set the spark,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
For all intended purposes,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Eh, singing just for you,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Without your sweet love,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Beyond here lies nothing,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
To keep up his hate,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
My love, she speaks softly,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Dream about you, baby,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
To be so useless and all,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Drifting too far from shore,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
But you were gambling for support,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
You don't have to feed me,
There's always someone who understands,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I fell down to my bended knees,
With his fist in a clinch,
I'm gonna let you pass,
It always means so much,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Well, I can't understand,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
You have given me eyes to see,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
For her to arrive,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Why she did go,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
I want my arms around you,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Want you,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
But I'm pressing on,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
And all of your children start to resent you,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Ooh, watered-down love,
And it's like I ain't here,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Well, I been gambling so long,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Seem like I been down this way before,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
And, if anybody asks me,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Like you never did before,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Oh, in somebody's room,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
God knows there's a river,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
You could look at it and weep,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
We'll go someplace unknown,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
The day would surely have to break,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Try hard, get barred,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I got no place left to turn,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
That they do not respect in any degree,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Watch the river flow,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
If anything is gonna sell,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
It was from her ship sailing,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
With what your fate is going to be,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
In one the surface was frozen,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
And your streets are getting empty,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Says he's got a bad cough,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
The night passed away so quickly,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Too serious to fool,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
The air is getting hotter,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And I got those worried blues,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
I should have left this town this morning,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Memory, ecstasy,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Now you don't talk so loud,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I don't wanna fake you out,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Silhouetted by the sea,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Don't know what to do without it,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
She's the worst you could ever have,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
It was you who came right through,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
When there is no more,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
And the sooner you come up with them,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Said I'm pressing on,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
The carpet too is moving under you,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Got my mind made up,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
But it ain't him to blame,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
It don't matter what you did,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
The only son of God Almighty,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
It could even be like a myth,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Advertising signs, they con,
Friends with you,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
And to come every time you call,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Dust on my face and my cape,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
That you'd have liked me to,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
"Not I," said the referee,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
But I'm saved,
A million faces at my feet,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Trust yourself,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Vanished from my hand,
I want you,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
It's rising up above my head,
Yesterday's just a memory,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
I just don't know what to do,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Mixing up the medicine,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Don't let yourself fall,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Look out, kid,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Like as not, it's better so,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
We live in a political world,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
While riding on a train going west,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
A complete unknown,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
To hang and to lynch,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
I'll be on my way,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
They walk among the stately trees,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
True love of mine,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
"Not me," said his manager,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
More people kept a-piling on,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Stone you and say good luck,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I need a shot of love,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
With his candle lit into the sun,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Don't let her see that you need her,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Too noble to neglect,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Circled by the circus sands,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
You can stick your head in the sand,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
She never does me wrong,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Looking for a new fool,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I can't understand,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Come on, come on, stick together,
And, though the line is cut,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
He's young and on fire,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Joey, Joey,
But I know that he don't talk,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
They say every distance is not near,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
As the present now will later be past,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Going, going, gone,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Get born, keep warm,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Keep me where you are,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
The country doctor rambles,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
God knows how to make it flow,
It still ain't me, babe,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Stand up straight and tall,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
Well, come all without, come all within,
You to me were true,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Giving back all of what you owe,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Don't wear sandals,
That the laws are with him,
God don't call it wrong,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
The haunted, frightened trees,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Each time we meet, love,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Face full of black soot,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
To be alone with you,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Icicles hanging down,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
I can finish this alone, honey,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
By losers, cheaters,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Poor boy never say die,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
God knows it's a struggle,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
And also by his feet,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Of this I can't say very much,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
If not for you,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
And it's only that I'm asking,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Keep a clean nose,
Trouble,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Six months on the chain gang,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Simplify you, classify you,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
But the bottles are done,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Want you so bad,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Father of time and father of dreams,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Don't let me change my heart,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
May be an actor in a plot,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
So unknown,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
It's like I ain't here,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
They must bust in early May,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
The train leaves at half past ten,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
You better chew gum,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
She'll surely turn to white,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Don't follow leaders,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
God knows it's a crime,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
I can see the turning of the key,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Well, get sick, get well,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
If you'd see me this way,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Who will promise never to part,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Where I will always be renewed,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Love that's pure no accident,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Front door shut, back door too,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
I swung on to my old guitar,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Pressing on,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Well, I may just swear,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
One by one they followed the sun,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
And you take just like a woman,
Looking 'bout the government,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
And on the highway of regret,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
And I'm so glad,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Don't ever try to change me,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I just don't see why I should even care,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
They say every man need protection,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Just like I did before,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Light yourself a candle,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Never did feel this way before,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Using every angle under the sun,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
You made it there somehow,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
A thousand miles from home,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
We live and we die, we know not why,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
A true love of mine,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
My woman's never sitting at home,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Four by four, no illusion for,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Under the microscope,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
We've killed each one,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Father of minutes, father of days,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Up and down the block,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Every brain is civilized,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
God knows it's fragile,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
I can't cross the line, you know,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
But, deep inside my heart,
I went down where the vultures feed,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
When I was in Missouri,
Father of black, father of white,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Well, the job that you used to have,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
And you make love just like a woman,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
You were snow, you were rain,
And, if I see the day,
I'd be sad and blue,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
You find God in the church of your choice,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I can make it through,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
You have given all there is to give,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
I know I can't win,
Tell me that you love me only,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
You need something to open your eyes,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Grandpa died last week,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Rabbit running down across the road,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Far away in the stormy night,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Someone to open each and every door,
Don't tie no bows,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Resent him to the bone,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
I'm going down the river,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
It hurts me, too,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Mercury, gravity,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Carved next to his name,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
In the image of someone you used to know,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
For his age he is wise,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
And, on their promises of paradise,
You're beautiful beyond words,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Disconnect these cables--
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
Ha-va-
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
I a-hope you can hear--
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
I hope that you can hear--
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
As suicide remarks are torn -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
You will not hear a laugh -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
Hang out the whole next day -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
Hava-na-
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
To know where you are -
Haven't seen her since that night -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
That can win what's a-never been won -
Remember me to one who lives there -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
Thank--
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
I'm sure it was not three -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
With notions his canoe was laden -
Havanagee-luh-
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
I got no idea what I want -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
Indians camp along her border -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
Havana-gee-
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
With no other choice except but for to go -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
Private reasons - great or small -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
It can't be this way everywhere -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
I long to hold you in the night -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
Turn, turn, turn again -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
Whispering your secret emotion -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
Leave all the children home -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Judge had the papers in his hand -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
Ten thousand miles or more -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
How badly they were shocked -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
That's where you belong --
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
Democracy don't rule the world --
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
First degree and second degree -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
Oh, my-
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
Fear to bring children into the world.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Like you never done before.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Sound like it's on a final run.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
You don't have to worry any more.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
What you'll say when you get home.
We may not make it through the night.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
For an instant hand touched hand.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Nobility, humility.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
So, darling, you better come through.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Come on, honey.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
You're a big girl all the way.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Baby, baby...
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Greenwich Village.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Neighborhood bully.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
You're bound to fall" - you thought they were all kidding you.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
He's always on trial for just being born.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
It was you who understood.
Tell me.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Rain would gather, too.
Baby, baby.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
To kill with no pain.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
That I left in the French Quarter.
You to me were the best.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Hoping you'll come through too.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
I'm not the one you need.
I will only let you down.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Is gonna be against the law.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
When I'm alone with you.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
About an old man that never done wrong.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Good car to drive, after a war.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Food was flying everywhere - I left without my hat.
Watch the parking meters.
And shot it fulla holes.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I want everybody to be free.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Headed out for the western skies.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
Because everybody must get stoned.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Come on, baby.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
She's in some foreign land.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Six by six...
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
At my window with a broken wing.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Go lightly on the ground.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
And they gotta cut something.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
It ain't quite the end.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
And ye shall be changed.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
You know, I loved her just the same.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
That old ship was a-going down.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
And I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
And light on your right knee.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Things will be alright by and by.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Crumble into one another.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Or stay all night with thee.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
And the people that confronted him were many.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Remember me to one who lives there.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Everything is gonna be alright.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
To keep her from the howling winds.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
I don't even know why we come.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Mortality, reality.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
Every link was Jesus's name.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
I got trouble in my mind.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
And it is time for me to slide.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Ever since I seen you there.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
With gold and silver in her hand.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
I'll only let you down.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
And watch the parking meters.
Until I threw it all away.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
I couldn't find any.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.

If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.

The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.

Drifting too far from shore.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Mama, you are on my mind.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.

When you go your way and I go mine.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
When the night comes falling from the sky.

When you made everybody pay.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
But I can't get close to her at all.
I threw it all away.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
I hate bears.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
And tapestry of rhyme.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Join the army if you fail.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
They would not let me be.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Till your error you clearly learn.
That must be what it's all about.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Most of the time.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
I hear them semis rolling too.
But I ain't got Corrina.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
My mind is breaking.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Unless they're from another world.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
I just can't do what I done before.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Yes, tell me.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Valentines can't buy her.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Buildings going up to the sky.
You got a heart of stone.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
I didn't feel so cold then.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.

You're my honey.
It was a normal day.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
And the night blows rainy.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.

The next day could be your last.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Looking for the places only they would know.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.

Lord, your highway's getting filled.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
For me to return to or chase.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
That Johanna's not here.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.

Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're-what you are but what you're not.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
While my conscience explodes.
I used to care, but things have changed.
She pretends like we never have met.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
All my connections too.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.

Is tell me that it isn't true.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.

I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
"And stay all night with me.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I never saw the man again.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Adios, mi corazon.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.

It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Please let me ride you home.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.

Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.

It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
The light I never knowed.
Going, going, gone.
And you only got ten.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Honey, baby.
And I need you, ah.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Someone who will die for you and more.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
This kind of love, I-I'm lovesick.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
In the border-towns of despair.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Can't see over to the other side.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
But you can't see in and I--it's hard looking out.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
I'm younger than that now.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
You're on the bottom.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Under the midnight moon.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
You don't have to be afraid.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Turned on my record player.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
But you're not even sure what it is.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Trying to create a next world war.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
She acts like we never met.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Just to take somebody's money away.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
That linger in the fireball heat.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
That keep us so tightly bound.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Funny way to start a picnic.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
As if a wedding vow.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Oh, Angelina.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
I took some comfort there.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
It runs both cold and deep.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
I'd be lost if not for you.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Even the softest touch.
Friends with you.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
I'm a poet, I know it.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
To anything I mighta tried.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
Throw my mattress out there too.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
I seen a man.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Father of love and father of rain.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
But simply because it's true.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
68, but says he's 24.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
And she had left him to die in there.
I got a bird that sings.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
He gone north for a while.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Means another poor boy is underground.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
And disregards the rest.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
If not for you.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
And laid his life on the line.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Broken voices on broken phones.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
While I'm in the hall.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Last radio is playing.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
"Don't trill no news on me.
And your highway's getting filled.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
But with the country to where you're going.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
I've seen trouble all my days.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Duality, mortality.
I don't know any more than this.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Is when I'm alone with you.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
I only saw what they let me see.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
To anything I might've tried.
This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".
Talking to myself in a monologue.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
Life don't mean a thing.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
His mama sure was proud of him.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
I know something is changed.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
I can't see through it anymore.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I--but I just don't know how.

But you said you knew and I took your word.
It's that million dollar bash.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
The hour that the ship comes in.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
With all these promises you left for me.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
And then go on home and have my fun.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Trust yourself.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
And I've never been too impressed.
Hope you're ready.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
My baby stole my heart from me.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Just like you've always smiled before.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
She can't find him anywhere.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
New morning.
And say you'll always let it be me.
He went down to Oxford Town.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Got to have done some evil deed.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Gonna serve somebody.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
Hmm, tell me.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Put me outta doors.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
It always does when you're with me.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
In the dark land of the sun.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
He ain't-a got no name.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
And then unto eternity.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
So long, honey babe.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
An innocent man in a living hell.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
68, but says she's 24.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
I can't hear you anymore.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
I's looking around just to see myself.
So I beg you: let it be me.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
That can win what's never been won.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
Epitome, rigidity.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
When he played and we didn't dance.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
The hour when the ship comes in.
The sooner you can leave.
Leading me, going home.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Chain you down or bring you down.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
See that my grave is kept clean.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
Slowly into autumn.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
To the sin of love's false security.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
I know the kinds of things you like.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
But all I see are dark eyes.
It only brings me sorrow.
Than people who are most content.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Without ideals or violence.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Lord, protect my child.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
God knows...
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
I followed the winding stream.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
It don't matter anyhow.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
On the caboose of the train.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
Got ice water in my veins.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
To see that you're madly in love.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
I'm falling in love with you.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
Baby, let me follow you down.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
You'd better get that in your head.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
She murdered mortal he.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
I shall be released.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
And the morning will be breaking.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Rain would gather too.
But these to tell what's true.
If you just let me follow you down.
Have fallen from her curls.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
I know you always say that you agree.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
I said that.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
There's no words that need to be said.
I can't use it anymore.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Don't have to look no further - you're the soul of many things.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Some place so high above the wall.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
And that failure's no success at all.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
By that soft and shining sea.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
The National Guard stands around his door.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
As the present now will later be past.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
So the radio didn't work so well.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Ever since I seen her smile.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
They seem determined to go all the way.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
Until my dying-day.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Need that woman straight and true.
But I was raised on the other.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
I can't fire them anymore.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
It sure is right on a night like this.
I hope I'm ready.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Where teardrops fall.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
I see that stationmaster too.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
If you just let me come home with you.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
I'm sad and lonely too.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
Patriotism, materialism.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.

The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
My beautiful comrade from the north.

Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
But mine was a little different, you see.
When they didn't wanna know or see.

And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.

I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.

Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
For that's the way I remember her best.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
And your golden loom.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
See like me or be like me.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.

If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
She said she would always stay.

With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Walking around with no one else.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.

When I've forgotten all the rest.
You'll never see me frown.
Step lightly on the ground.
And left me here facing the wall.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.

With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
With your golden loom.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.

Bring that bottle over here.
To the old folks' home and the college.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
By the saving grace that's over me.
With the glory that is to be.

To reach of your rattling drums.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
High society, notoriety.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
And the Santa Fe.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
And time is beginning to crawl.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
When she's better only time'll tell.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
You're my baby.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
In the pale moonlight.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Well, our captain, he is dead - died for a maid.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Tried to create a next world war.
I need a shot of love.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Crying out that he was framed.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
Or define you or confine you.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
Tell me that it isn't true.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
Some place so high above this wall.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
It hurts me, too.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
I don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Someone I really could care for.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
You're gonna need my help someday.
In my Cadillac.
When my memory is not so short.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Even before you came in the door.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Yeah, serve somebody:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Serve somebody:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
But there's one promise, darling:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Man is opposed to fair play:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
His epitaph plain:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Till I come into New York town:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
All lies and jest;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
So many things that we never will undo;
Had to be held down by big police;
Make promises by the hour;
Some speak of the future;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
I find complete love;
Crumble into one another;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Are you ready?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Can you get back in?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
What can I give to You?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Am I still dreaming yet?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
How many compared to yesterday?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
And one deserving of affection?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Who killed Davey Moore?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
To love and follow His direction?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before he can see the sky?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Oh, how could you refuse?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Of everything you see?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Does anyone even try?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Before he can hear people cry?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Before you call him a man?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
That too many people have died?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
Why and what's the reason for?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Across the swooping plain?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
What good am I?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
How could they let you go?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
How come you don't send me no regards?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
When did you leave heaven?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
And how does it feel?
Where did you hide your halo?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Just like a rolling stone?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Too many people have died?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
What else can a poor boy do?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
I seen better times, but who has not?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Ready, George?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why would I want to take your life?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
How many more can they afford?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Gal, where you been so long?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What would life be?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
How's everything in heaven?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
So I can know if I'm really real?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
For all these earthly things?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
How many more without any reward?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Baby, can't you tell?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Must everybody bow?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Across the swamp of time?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Has anybody seen my love?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
What can I do for You?
What?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Oh, so why not you and me?
How does it feel?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
How can I live for You?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
How much poison did they inhale?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
What's wrong with you this time?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Have they missed you?
How could they ever mistake you?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Is it rolling, Bob?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When he's standing in front of you?
Can I come home with you?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Am I ready?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
By golly, what more can I say?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Baby, can I come home with you?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Before it is washed to the sea?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Poor boy, where you been?
Where did you lose your wings?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Before they're forever banned?
Like a rolling stone?
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
It was put together down in Argentina
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
"Equality". I spoke the word
You used--be so proud
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Now, a very great man once said
How many times can a man turn his head
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
I want you, baby, just to understand
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Then came the warning that was before the flood
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
Maybe someday you will understand
And then you told me later as I apologized
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Nothing was delivered
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
I run right home and I went to bed
We live in a political world
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
I live in another world
By no special friend
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
I've been walking around
I thought that it was well-understood
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I'll always thank the Lord
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
But now something has changed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
I still can remember the way that you smiled
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Either from the mountains of Madrid
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
So I'll make my stand
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
I will not go down under the ground
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Just what you had in mind
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
And into the path you are hurled
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
As I stand upon the sand
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Now you don't act so--so proud
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
I had to say something to strike him very weird
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
But something has changed
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Somebody seen him hanging around
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
He was a clean-cut kid
All the sweethearts you can hold
You try so hard, but you don't understand
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
There ain't nothing in this world
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
They took a clean-cut kid
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
You used to be so amused
Roving gambler, he was very bored
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
But she ain't gonna find the road
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And your trouble is you know it too good
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Its iron claws attached
Things would be different the next time we wed
But all that suffering was not to be compared
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Now, whenever I get up and
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
And that even the nobles get properly handled
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Silvio, silver and gold
For what you sold that's not been received
Standing on the water, casting your bread
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
She let go of my hand
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
And things would be different the next time we wed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
To see him obviously framed
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
It's something you did
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Many times I've often prayed
Now you don't seem so proud
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And those whom doom and death had spared
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
While some, on principles baptized
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
He'll see by his grave
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
That she's the same one
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Little did I realize
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
If dogs run free, why not me
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Should I put them by your gate
They say don't come back no more
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
I am homeless, come and take me
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
With all memory and fate
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
I don't even notice she gone
When Reilly's daughter got a message
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
You cut to the core
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
You just pick anyone
You could almost think that you're seeing double
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Remember me to one who lives there
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
From all the plans they do pursue
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
So up she picked her babies three
Limited in sex they dare
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Up into some paradise
She been gone
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
How was I to know you'd be the one
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
I'm sure you're the one to blame
What about that millionaire
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
You smiling through the fence at me
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Among the lovely people living free
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
We see this empty cage now corrode
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And I ain't complaining none
Full of hope and desire
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And I'm just the same as anyone else
You know, it's not even safe no more
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Well, it's all new to me
And plenty time for good romance
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
And you see why it's so unique to be
So I remember every face
Con you into thinking that you're the one
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Everybody's wearing a disguise
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
And suddenly there appeared before me
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Knows there's no success like failure
You say you're looking for someone
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
She plunged him into well water where
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
What good am I then to others and me
And never sat once at the head of the table
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
I'm ready for to fade
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
You into thinking you're the one
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
While them that defend what they cannot see
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
The cause was there before we came
When I'm all alone
But the dark does die
It's all new to me
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Just pick anyone
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
See the primitive wallflower freeze
So I look like a walking mountain range
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Though its shadow's metal badge
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
A bed that is never mine
To show you something you seen before
If dogs run free, then what must be
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And that is that one must always flush out his house
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
A girl who would murder her own, true love
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
But it won't be over till they clear his name
There were times when I was so lonesome
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Where I could watch her waltz for free
"It's only you that he does crave
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
And I would send a message
Looking at hands for the lines that were
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
If dogs run free, why not we
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
From the Golden Gate Bridge
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Says it's closing time
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Just what you will say when you get home
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
So, I called up the operator of time
And her silver-studded phantom cause
To give the special one you seek a chance
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
From the start by the rule
I can survive and I can endure
I been wondering all about me
The crashing waves roll over me
But I can get another one
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
You're not free to belong to me
Hunger pays a heavy price
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Breaking hearts up and down the line
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
What's probably got you baffled more
But I can't say I sympathize
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Should I leave them by your gate
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
On the rising curve
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
How many ears must one man have
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
When the rain is blowing in your face
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Taking care of somebody nice
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And the Negro's name
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
The man the authorities came to blame
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
You said you'd never compromise
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Mona tried to tell me
When the roses fade
As he rises to fame
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
At dawn my lover comes to me
It'll be with me unto the grave
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
All I feel is heat and flame
I do declare
I rode with him in a taxi once
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
But I feel nothing for their game
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Lies that life is black-and-white
Maybe someday you will look back and see
She knows there's no success like failure
Feel to moan, but unlike before
What you're gonna say when you get home
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Better stay away from those
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Remember me to the one who lives there
It's getting dark, too dark to see
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Waiting to find out what price
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Oh, trust yourself
Trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
You left me standing in the doorway crying
The battle outside raging
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
I know that you know that I know that you show something
But then a whistle will be blowing
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Beyond here lies nothing
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
It's not a bad way to make a living
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Deceived me into thinking
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
The order is a-rapidly fading
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
The order is rapidly fading
They're drinking up and walking
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Where the time and the tempo drag
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
I can hear their hearts a-beating
For your weary toes to be touching
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
For your weary toes to be a-touching
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
She rode by night and came by morning
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Well, I set my monkey on the log
'Cause the battle outside raging
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
There's nothing in here moving
If I was with her too long
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And how I know I'll make it through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Look out, the saints are coming through
I have fallen far beneath
You go north and you go south
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Then she told us how times were tough
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
Make everything from toy guns that spark
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Well, there ain't no going back
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
But they caught him and they brought him back
The man in me will do nearly any task
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
You turn around to take a final peek
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Shoot in the back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Her voice once and talk
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
I wish she'd unlock
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
How does it feel
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Muttering small talk at the wall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
A-how does it feel
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
A girl by the whirlpool
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Ring bell, hard to tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
They ask me how I feel
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
How many seas must a white dove sail
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Oh, how does it feel
Then why don't she tell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
How many seas must the white dove sail
Ring bar, hard to tell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
As the last fire-truck from hell
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
But among the dead that were left on the hill
All and all can only fall
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
And if my love is real
To make all that should be killed to crawl
He's taught in his school
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
He's sure got a lot of gall
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
I chased me a woman up the hill
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But I can hear another drum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Two eyes took the aim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
"For you cannot relive them
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
You better not chew gum
And remain as I am
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
And the corner sign
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Guns and clubs followed him down
Please don't let on that you knew me when
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
I'll be waiting at the station
Well, you fake just like a woman
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
That long, black train is pulling on down
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Yes, and someone must explain
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
My love, she's like some raven
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Will not be understood as they're spoken
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
But the second mother was with the seventh son
The next morning she had awoken
Darkness at the break of noon
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
From heights that they could not gain
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
But me, I expected it to happen
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Why did you trade heaven
I figure maybe we're even
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Advertising signs that con
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
You take just like a woman
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Suicide remarks are torn
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Must meet the dawn
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
And all their daughters put me down
Somebody new to beat on
That long, black train is pulling down
She said that all the railroad men
Nothing we can call our own
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Out of the shower comes a football man
You need something to make it known
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Trying to get a lead on
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
How many roads must a man walk down
He got that fortress on the mountain
And you ache a-just like a woman
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Have died in battle or in vain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
She got such a sweet disposition
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
But I swear I see my reflection
But the post office has been stolen
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
All their daughters put me down
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
And she wakes just like a woman
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
But all their daughters put me down
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
And the smell of their roses does not remain
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
To my knowledge there's just one man
But it's hard to think on
She takes just like a woman
In the pigpen
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
In ceremonies of the horsemen
The foreign sun, it squints upon
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
And she aches just like a woman
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
For the loser now will be later to win
A-she takes just like a woman
To remember the times when I was your only man
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
The ones that jump on the wagon
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Their religion of the little ten women
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
You don't need a weatherman
Poor boy in a red-hot town
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
"Not me," said the gambling man
And there's no exit in any direction
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Yet I swear I see my reflection
For the loser now might be later to win
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Well, I'm hanging on
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
How can the life of such a man
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
There is a place you go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
There's nothing you can say or do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
All I really wanna do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All I'd like you to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Every place I wanna go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Silvio, I gotta go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
The very last thing that I'd want to do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
How many times must a man look up
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
The man in the coon-skin cap
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Aladdin and his lamp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
I walked down there and ended up
What good am I while you softly weep
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
So, don't fear if you hear
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
The wind howls like a hammer
My ship is in the harbor
She took him by his long, yellow hair
I could feel a whole lot better
I don't have to go far
The face of God will appear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When you whispered in my ear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
All you boys better run for cover
When only you are near
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
For I am married to a house carpenter
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
The lover who has just walked out your door
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
I close my eyes and I wonder
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
I say, "Why you say that for
Never no more do I wonder
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
But morning is clear
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Still I say her love-words over
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
In one I was running and in another
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And I don't even think about her
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
Still I've always kind of missed her
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
You heard me saying a prayer for
At any moment you could go under
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Who came here from Cuba's door
For all eternity I think I will remember
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I try to tell it like it is
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
When your mother sends back all your invitations
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You know that he has no intentions
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
And the poor white remains
You can fall down on your knees
And tells me of her dreams
I'd gladly confess
Six-time losers
And the princess and the prince discuss
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Romantic facts of musketeers
To memorizing politics
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Good and bad, I define these terms
You should be made to wear earphones
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
And without further notice asks you how it feels
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
In the dimestores and bus-stations
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
I'm gonna let you pass
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
To sharpen the senses
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
People carry roses
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Now, you must provide some answers
At times I think there are no words
And inside it with the people made of molasses
That it's you and no one else that owns
Well, the ragman draws circles
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Glide across the lonely years
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Statues made of matchsticks
Seven days
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
The cowboy angel rides
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Six-time users
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And, though the masters make the rules
But still remains
You never turned around to see the frowns
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Don't follow leaders
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
True love can make a blade of grass
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Mama, you know, awaits the news
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
How many deaths will it take till he knows
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On the back of the fish truck that loads
To the cutting of fences
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
As friends and other strangers
What good am I if I say foolish things
He's not selling any alibis
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Wants eleven dollar bills
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
We living in times when men commit crimes
Thinking of a series of dreams
But, though the masters make the rules
Don't wear sandals
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
And I try to harmonize with songs
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
"Not me," said the man whose fists
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And then complains
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Girl by the whirlpool's
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Her window's wide open, African trees
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
You been hurt so many times
With a big bouquet of the roses
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
They whisper in the wings
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
And your father, to your sister he explains
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
People on the platforms
With a fantastic collection of stamps
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And so Patty calls the cops
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
He built a fire on Main Street
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
That might be all that you got
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Plants in the bed, but
Talking that the heat put
They tell me revenge is sweet
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
So he never thinks straight
Without any doubt
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
You used to laugh about
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
You're hearing my heart beat
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
There's some people that
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
He really wasn't where it's at
And, since my feet are now fast
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
I'm moving after midnight
Everyone still talks about
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
I'm on the pavement
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
But, if the arrow is straight
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
How many years can a mountain exist
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
How many years can some people exist
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Johnny's in the basement
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Keep me set apart
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Wait for the morning light
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
In the precious winds they rot
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Oh, everybody's got to eat
It don't take too long to find out
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
With your pockets well protected at last
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
One more night the moon is shining bright
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
The slowest now will later be fast
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Everything is always right
I got into the driver's seat
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
You're gonna get hit
They tell me to be discreet
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
To keep it in your mind and not forget
In the stillness of the midnight
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Well, I finally started thinking straight
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
We can hold up a toast if we meet
I think that it's best
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
To hold each other tight
And the first one now will later be last
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
You don't forget
The slow one now will later be fast
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Like a corkscrew to my heart
I soon get some rest
By the way, that's a cute hat
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Our Father would not like the way that you act
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
One more night I will wait for the light
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
But, then again, there's only one I've met
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Keep it in your mind and not forget
She seems too far out
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
You used to laugh-make fun about
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
You are there in the flickering light
And I, in my armor, turning about
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I'll remember you
It's just crazy being here with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To protect you and defend you
And I tell this truth to you
I just might have to come see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I can be just like you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To be alone with you
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Well, I'd sure like to know
Down every street there's a window
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
He been living there three years now
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Don't it always go to show
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
With only you in view
It only goes to show
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
But sooner or later one of us must know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I'd sure like to know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
The only one I know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Sooner or later one of us must know
Don't it always a-go to show
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Don't you tell Henry
For them that must obey authority
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Though I'd never say
My ears hear a symphony
That I was just a puppet in a play
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Went to the doctor the very next day
We banged the drum slowly
Someone to get you flowers constantly
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Well, I'm walking down the highway
From phony jealousy
He made the bells of freedom ring today
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
To those condemned to act accordingly
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Well, I saw it advertised one day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
She smiles, walks the other way
And the only tune my guitar could play
That I done it the way
And it's up to you to say
Is worth more than I could pay
Maggie says that many say
If I don't take the chance to try
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
So, I'm walking down your highway
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
I did not do it harmfully
A cock is crowing far away
The same thing I would want today
So they took him to the infirmary
How many times must the cannon balls fly
She puts it to me plain as day
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
And that which you've given me today
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Spouted out that liberty
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
My mind weaves a symphony
So I run down most hurriedly
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Or if you just want some company
And I'm leaving every day to run away
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
And for His love they took His life away
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
But you can never steal away
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
For them that think death's honesty
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
The Spanish-American War had its day
She knocked upon it anyway
But I can't deny
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
I send you all my money
And the ladies treat me kindly
No, you'll not now or no other day
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
She starts to speak, but he walks away
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
For them that think death--death's honesty
