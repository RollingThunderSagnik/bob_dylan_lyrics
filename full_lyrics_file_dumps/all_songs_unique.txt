Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Play that guitar now!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
I'm in love with you!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Dance!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Oh!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
He punched me out!
Lordy, Lord!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Woo-hoo!
Alright, now!
Goodnight!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Yes, come out your window!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Betty Ross!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
You're a liar!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
Pressing on - oh, yes, I am!
I ain't different than anyone!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Alright!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Yippee!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I got the freight train blues!
So long, New York!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
They was all over!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
I've got a million friends!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Yeah, man!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Howdy, East Orange!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Dignity never been photographed!
Thank you!
Woo!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
Well!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!

The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, no!
I've got the freight train blues!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Hootenanny television!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
Start over!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
They got away!
I wanna be yours!
Take me down to California, baby!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
How they ever flood my soul!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Good God!
She's insane!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
You must think I'm crazy!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
My God, they killed Him!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
It was the mailman!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Play fucking loud!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Oh, yeah!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Them Reds did it!
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
You must know about my debutante."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Get on your horse and ride away."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
It's all for the love of thee."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Will mourn for your return."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
Come flowing down so free?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
I would want again tomorrow."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And pretend that you never have met."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I'll bring back my lady."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
And hung on a willow tree."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
I'll see her soon, I know."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
But we were tangled up in blue."
I didn't see you around."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
For that reason I will have to stay."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I love far better than thee."
I can't find my knees."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
But I know what you want."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
So write to her tenderly."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
And keep him good company."
From across that lonesome ocean."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
God said, "On Highway 61."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
We'll both go home together."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
I'll apply them all to thee."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
You can't blame us at all."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
We'll both go off together."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
That you must always first forgive them."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And have it on Highway 61."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Country'll grow."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
And it's all for the love of thee."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
They look as dark as night."
They look as white as snow."
"Is it easy to forget?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
You and I'll never know."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
We want folksingers here."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Would kill a little bird like me."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
I'll endow them onto thee."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Tangled up in blue."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
And punched my cigarette."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Have it on Highway 61."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Where you and I will unite."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You can't blame me at all."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
"That way down Highway 61."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
"I've had too much of your company,"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Loyalty, unity,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Wasn't making any great connection,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
I got two white horses following me,
They--they show me to the door,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Six months on the chain gang,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Don't let her know that you love her,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
My love, she speaks softly,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
To your tambourine in time,
See her in that very tight skirt,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I think we better talk this over,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
We take great delight in our own company,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
They say every distance is not near,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Like you never did before,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
With the juice running down my leg,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Poor boy never say die,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
If I didn't have to guess,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
A hand set the spark,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
For she ain't the same,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Automobile coming into style,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
God knows it's outta sight,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
And I'm so glad,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
People talk of situations,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
And she aches just like a woman,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
You need something to open up a new door,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Not the end, not the end,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Like some mystery,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Three by three they're turning the key,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Don't mind the driving rain,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
Just remember that death is not the end,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Well, I don't mind dying,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
There she come, now, down my way,
Waiting for the trains,
You'll be doing society a favor,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Going, going,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
But evidently she don't,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Nothing too very scientific,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Want you,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Like a complete unknown,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Tell her not to worry,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Pressing on,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
You have given everything to me,
Well, I gave you all my money,
If you throw it all away,
Going,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
That they do not respect in any degree,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
My limbs are shaking,
The wind blowing the snow around,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
I couldn't see where we were going,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
And, though the line is cut,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
I had so much left to do,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
The kingdoms of experience,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
If you'd see me this a-way,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
And she'll be coming forth,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I just say no thanks,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Give you my money, honey,
And, if anybody asks me,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Who will promise never to part,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I've been around this whole country,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Baby, please stop crying,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
She said she would never forget,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Watered-down love,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Watch the plain-clothes,
Day you quit me, baby,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
It always has hit me from below,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
And the table's full and overflowed,
To be so useless and all,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
I'd only have to stay,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
But he's the property of Jesus,
We'll fly the night away,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
No direction home,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
It's alright,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Someone to close his hear,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
So many roads, so much at stake,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Under the microscope,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
You have explained every mystery,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Vanished from my hand,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Equality, liberty,
I wish tonight were here,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
You need something to open your eyes,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Circled by the circus sands,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I once held her in my arms,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
All I really wanna do,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Yes, I'm so glad,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Like a dog on a chain,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
God knows it's a crime,
To be without a home,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
To shine in through,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
On this new morning, new morning,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Out to the windy beach,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
While paupers change possessions,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
They keep it all hid,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
That five walls cannot hide him,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
I have no one to meet,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
True love of mine,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
I'll be on my way,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Where life and death are memorized,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Come all without, come all within,
Said I'm pressing on,
Well, the job that you used to have,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
God knows that, when you see it,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
I been good while I been waiting,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
You could look at it and weep,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Since you've been gone,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
She leave by the other and roam,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
People carry roses,
Is it really any wonder,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
You to me were true,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Far away in the stormy night,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
So glad,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
The man there said he loved my sound,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I won't have my nature way,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Now, won't you tell me true,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
You even make love just like a woman,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
It's really something,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
You broke a heart that loved you,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Or select you or dissect you,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
And all of your children start to resent you,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Serve somebody,
Precious angel under the sun,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Thieving in the alley,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
To keep up his hate,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
And it's only that I'm asking,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
And here I sit so patiently,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
God knows you ain't pretty,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
"Come along and take a trip,
If you'd see me this way,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Don't let yourself fall,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Got me a secret membership card,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
When the night comes falling,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Front door shut, back door too,
They say every man need protection,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Father of air and father of trees,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
Someone to open each and every door,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Each time we meet, love,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Like a rolling stone,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Eh, see what you can do,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
A thousand miles from home,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Or have done something wrong,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
And may you stay forever young,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
All you can do is do what you must,
I just keep pressing on,
Ye shall be changed,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
China doll, alcohol,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
My existence led by confusion boats,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Well, I been gambling so long,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Stand up straight and tall,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
"Not I," said the referee,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
But you're doing it again,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
So unknown,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
You will be alright, girl,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Someone to close his heart,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Stripping away at it all,
And it's like I ain't here,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
And on the highway of regret,
Without a love of my own,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
May be living in another country under another name,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
But I will be back, I will survive,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
It was from her ship sailing,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Silvio, I gotta go,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Went back home to the yard,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Broken hands on broken plows,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
My arms and legs were broken,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
And, if I can save you any time,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Over your senses you have no control,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
You gotta look some other place,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
With a killer's pride, security,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Don't tie no bows,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
First degree and second degree,
I'd already gone the distance,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Go down to the river, babe,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
I shall be released,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
My hands didn't touch him none,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
The sky too is folding under you,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Well, there ain't no going back,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
And gathering storms may arise,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
I'm never, never far from home,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
I got the worried blues,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Is used, it is plain,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Aim well, my little one,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
In the little church a-this side of town,
They say everything can be replaced,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
The joint is jumping,
They don't believe in mercy,
So I got those worries blues,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
It's rising up above my head,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
And, on their promises of paradise,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Father of day, father of night,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Loneliness, tenderness,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
I landed up on the downtown side,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Drifting too far from shore,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
You better chew gum,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
God knows how to make it flow,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
At the close of the day,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
"Not me," said his manager,
We've killed each one,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
God knows there's a heaven,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
To hang and to lynch,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
New morning,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
And joined the John Birch Society,
And, if I see the day,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
The phone's tapped anyway,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
God knows it's fragile,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
See you fly or watch you die,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Made of silver or of golden,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I don't care if you analyze me,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
I want my arms around you,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
But the bottles are done,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
May be the head of some big TV network,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Face full of black soot,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
I get my sweet reward,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Someone who will die for you and more,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
You made it there somehow,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I run right home and I went to bed,
We live and we die, we know not why,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
I rambled out of New York town,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Hang around the ink-well,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
By losers, cheaters,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Just as long as you stay with me,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I got my mind made up,
I know I can't win,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
God knows there's a chance,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Strangers all give me the news,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
He won't do nothing to you,
I want you so bad,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
But, if you want me to,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Judge and jury took their stand,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
They say that every man must fall,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
He is centuries old,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
It's not aimed at anyone,
You have given me life to live,
All the silver, all the gold,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
And I'm just like that bird,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
And I'm in the shade,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
The air is getting hotter,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
I got those worried blues,
Wintertime in New York town,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Tell me,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
At ships with tattooed sails,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I swung on to my old guitar,
The Second World War came to an end,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
God knows you've got to weep,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
That fired the gun,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Five by five they tried to survive,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
The angels play on their horns all day,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
To know how much I really care,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Holding his club like he was a king,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
God don't call it treason,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
I want you,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
But ye shall be a-changed,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Carved next to his name,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
If she ain't feeling well,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
They lowered him down as a king,
Seem like I been down this way before,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
With no direction home,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Searching everywhere I know,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
I been riding the midnight train,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Look out, kid,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
I never can go because, you know,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
But you were gambling for support,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
In a pine box for all eternity,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
To be one your own,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Precious father, loving mother,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
When I seen him lose control,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
I threw it all away,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
If'n you don't know by now,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
All that and more and then some,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
You don't have to feed me,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
She'll be coming forth,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
I been good,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Oh, see what you can do,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
But I know that he don't talk,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Looking for a new fool,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Make you spin or do you in,
Just to know that you are near,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
In his anger and his shame,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
You and me, we had completeness,
And you make love just like a woman,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Carry the New York Times,
You wanna drown love,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Broken lines, broken strings,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
The country doctor rambles,
Stone you and say good luck,
The Communists was a-coming around,
If you must cling to someone,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
God knows it's a struggle,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
God don't call it wrong,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
I'll go see them come down my way,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
My dear, sweet friend,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
And give him back the time he's done,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Eh, in somebody's room,
May you stay forever young,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Over the hills and far away,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
I long to see you in the morning light,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
And there's two white horses following me,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Ever since I been a child,
As human gods aim for their mark,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Don't let her know,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
They say every man must fall,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
You can run down to the desert,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
But I'm pressing on,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Up and down the block,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
You were striped, you were plain,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Who's never weak but always strong,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Heart of mine,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Of this I can't say very much,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
You were snow, you were rain,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
A true love of mine,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
I got no place left to turn,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Don't try No Doz,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Don't let her see,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
This place ain't doing me any good,
The day would surely have to break,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Without a dream in my heart,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Bring the wife and family,
Everything's a-hers or his,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
He's the property of Jesus,
Private reasons, great or small,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
I wish I a-was a magician,
While riding on a train going west,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
That must be what it's all about,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
In the hills of mystery,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
It's too bad he had to go,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Four by four, no illusion for,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Better jump down a manhole,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
You're beautiful to me,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Makes no difference where she's been,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Never weak but always strong,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Seven days,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
As his youth now unfolds,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Precious memories, how they linger,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
This situation can only get rougher,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Don't let her hear,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Watch the river flow,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Tears on the letter that I write,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Somewhere down the road some day,
To a solid rock,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Advertising signs, they con,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
In the instant that I preach,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
In one the surface was frozen,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
You have given me eyes to see,
Had no one to go my bail,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
She's opened up a happy home,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Each one playing a horn,
He's young and on fire,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
One by one they followed the sun,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I would not feel so all alone,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
They say every man must need protection,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
That can do what's a-never been done,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
A worried man with a worried mind,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
I thank the Lord,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Well, I'm so glad,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Maybe when we both get sober,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
But the time ain't tall,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
The midnight rain follows the train,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
You find God in the church of your choice,
For his age he is wise,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
It don't matter what you did,
And to come every time you call,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Never did feel this way before,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
And not going through any great extreme,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
But I've been hanging on,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Pick you up every time you fall,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
In the end,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Yes, I want you so bad,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I ain't looking to block you up,
This world is ruled by violence,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
And I got the worried blues,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
They pass by so silently,
When there is no more,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
A man named Martin Luther King,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
By the night and been to some place new,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Simplify you, classify you,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
I can change, I swear,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
But, if I can save you any time,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
He got that soft, silky skin,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Heart of mine, be still,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Looking 'bout the government,
It still ain't me, babe,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
I can't be good, baby,
The path you've endured has been rough,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
But, to remain as friends,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
The winter would hold no spring,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
In the foggy web of destiny,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
In the turning of twilight,
But now morning is clear,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
They say every man needs protection,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
A dream about you, baby,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
How he died nobody could say,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
I can't understand,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
And comes to a permanent stop,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
I just don't know what to do,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Three angels up above the street,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
People going down to the ground,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
I went into the city, went into the town,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
For the wise men and the fools,
Well, well, well,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
To protect his white skin,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
You have given all there is to give,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
The sky too is folding over you,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Mercury, gravity,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
You got to serve somebody,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
The night passed away so quickly,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I don't want to meet your kin,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Too serious to fool,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
And it still ain't me, babe,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Resent him to the bone,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
You're beautiful beyond words,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
She'll surely turn to white,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Love that's pure no accident,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
For her to arrive,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Roll, Willie, roll,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
My senses have been stripped,
Thank You, Lord,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Laying low,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
In the lonely night,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
And ye shall be a-changed,
The beat is pumping,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Well, I can't understand,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Well, I may just swear,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
But something has changed,
You follow, find yourself at war,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
When I was in Missouri,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
But, if I will save you the time,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
To be out on your own,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
But you try with your whole soul,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
I love you, pretty baby,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Dream about you, baby,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
It was you who came right through,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Grandpa died last week,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Relationships of ownership,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And think they're fooling you,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
True love, they've been without it,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Far away from it all,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
On the stone that remains,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
My woman needs it every day,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Yet every distance is not near,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Look away, you rolling river,
And you know I could never be your own,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
And, although that we're single and free,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
And I--I walk out on my own,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
She got great big hind legs,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Far away and over the wall,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Friends with you,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
I can't cross the line, you know,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
To be on your own,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Is looking for a new fool,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
The country music station plays soft,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
She never does me wrong,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Icicles hanging down,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Every brain is civilized,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
The night would see me wide awake,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Adios, mi corazon,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
A complete unknown,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
She said she would always stay,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Eh, singing just for you,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Oh, watered-down love,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Try hard, get barred,
Broken idols, broken heads,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
I'd be sad and blue,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
My love, she speaks like silence,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
When all will be well,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
And played the fife lowly,
Stay away from the train line,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Where the neon madmen climb,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
The day you quit me, baby,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
With what your fate is going to be,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Whether you are right or wrong,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
Just like I did before,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
It hurts me, too,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
I've been saved - well, alright,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
A man with a badge skips by,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
I went back home, put on my tie,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
You had enough of hatred,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Beyond here lies nothing,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
The man in the trench-coat,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
She would have married me,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Dust on my face and my cape,
You have laid down Your life for me,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
And the whole world is on your case,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
I'm leaving today,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
The one we can see and can feel,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
And it ain't me, babe,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Couldn't even see the floor,
And I know what you're thinking of,
I'm going out of my mind,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
God knows everything,
Try to be a success,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Madams light the candles,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
When she lays upon the grass,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Why she did go,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Without ideals or violence,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
For the politician's gain,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
We live in a political world,
Speaking to some French girl,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Gonna serve somebody,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
I just don't see why I should even care,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
Don't let me change my heart,
Don't know what to do without it,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Of ancient history,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Watching the river flow,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
And also by his feet,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Keep a clean nose,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Without your sweet love,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Every head is so dignified,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Get back, write Braille,
They tell me every man must fall,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
You can hear them tires squeal,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
The human mind can only stand so much,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Just then the order came to charge,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Got my mind made up,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
You'll change your last name, too,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
But it ain't me, babe,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,

My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
In love and with kindness,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,

From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Go away from my window,
A million faces at my feet,
Every moon is so sanctified,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Memory, ecstasy,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
You can raise up your right hand,
Using every angle under the sun,
One by one until there were none,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,

Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
And you take just like a woman,
Forever young, forever young,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Saved,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,

It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
That you'd have liked me to,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,

Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
In the image of someone you used to know,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Father of black, father of white,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
To find out if she's talked,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Winter would have no spring,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
It always means so much,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
And your streets are getting empty,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
And point away from the past,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
I went out last night to take a little round,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Want you so bad,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Corrina, Corrina,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
People talk over situations,
Beating for the dead that rise,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
He's not selling any alibis,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Tell me that you love me only,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I bless the day I found you,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
If your time to you is worth saving,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
They took a clean-cut kid,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
As the daylight hours do increase,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Strike another match, go start anew,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Courage is a thing of the past,
The light I never knowed,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
If anything is gonna sell,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
So, never leave me lonely,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
You stole her love from me one day,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Living in the land of Nod,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
That her father was going to hang,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
That the laws are with him,
I got a wife and five little children,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I got a bird that whistles,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
If not for you,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Drag you down or drain you down,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Thinking about the government,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
And I'm back in the rain,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Better jump down the manhole,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
You got something better,
I went into the city, into the town,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
And they--they look at me and frown,
I need a shot of love,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I could have left this town by noon,
Joey, Joey,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
To have--be on your own,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Keep me where you are,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Into my own parade,
It could even be like a myth,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
In the great unknown,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Bringing me all of your charms,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
That fellow who never blushes,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
It's a price I have to pay,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
They must bust in early May,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Who could they get to carry you,
Just like a rolling stone,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Too noble to neglect,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Ain't no going back,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Staying far behind without you,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Yesterday is just a memory,
One by one they follow the sun,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Oh, singing just for you,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
And forget my pride,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Love don't have any place,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
More people kept a-piling on,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
They run a brick and tile company,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Paradise, sacrifice,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
I got a woman, she's so mean,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
No, nothing was delivered,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Well, get sick, get well,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
To be alone with you,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Just don't know what to do,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Look who's back in town,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Nothing was delivered,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Go melt back in the night,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
As the present now will later be past,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
Going, going, gone,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
By rivers of blindness,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
I had a dream about you, baby,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You married young just like your ma,
Mixing up the medicine,
Human gods aim for their mark,
In the darkness of my night,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
But it ain't him to blame,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
For something that he never done,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
I can see the turning of the key,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
With his candle lit into the sun,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
God knows there's a purpose,
God knows when,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Don't ever try to change me,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
To be--direction home,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Going home,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
And come every time you call,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Trouble,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
May be an actor in a plot,
God knows it's terrifying,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
I try my best to be like I am,
I don't care if you feel like me,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
And the point is slick,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
How he died nobody can say,
From their fates try to resign,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
To gather flowers constantly,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
My woman's never sitting at home,
And to come each time you call,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Don't follow leaders,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
You say my kisses are not like his,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Badge out, laid off,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
But, deep inside my heart,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Searching high, searching low,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Father of night, father of day,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Rabbit running down across the road,
I tried to reach you, honey,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I'm so glad,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
All them prophets good and gone,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Like as not, it's better so,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
You want watered-down love,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
For all intended purposes,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I should have left this town this morning,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Socialism, hypnotism,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Something about you that I can't shake,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
God sees it all unfold,
But I would not feel so all alone,
That can do what's never been done,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Don't let me drift too far,
They walk among the stately trees,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
It's like I ain't here,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
But it would not be new,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
God knows there's a river,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Don't wear sandals,
To stay closer than any friend,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
He been around the world and back again,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
I'm pledging my time to you,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
But he can't be blamed,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Need a woman all the time,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Oh, Angelina,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
To strict party-platform ties,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Light yourself a candle,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
How does it feel,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Get born, keep warm,
Trust yourself,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
By users, cheaters,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Don't matter what you did,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Can't find what I need,
I'm going down the river,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Where I will always be renewed,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
I can make it through,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Stone you when you are young and able,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
She once was a true love of mine,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
I just can't beg you anymore,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
You've got to serve somebody,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Yes, and I'll go last,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
If ever I prove false to you,
With his fist in a clinch,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And furnish me with tape,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
One more night the stars are in sight,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Don't you tell Henry,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
You got something I want plenty of,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
There's always someone who understands,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
You came down on me like white thunder,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I ask you how things could get much worse -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
I got no idea what I want -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
Leave all the children home -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
You will not hear a laugh -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
Whispering your secret emotion -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
That's where you belong --
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
Without a reply I left by the moon -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
Indians camp along her border -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Hang out the whole next day -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
Democracy don't rule the world --
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Remember me to one who lives there -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Ha-va-
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
Havanagee-luh-
Oh, my-
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
First degree and second degree -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
Private reasons - great or small -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
Haven't seen her since that night -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
That can win what's a-never been won -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
Thank--
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
Havana-gee-
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
To know where you are -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Ten thousand miles or more -
I long to hold you in the night -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
With notions his canoe was laden -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
I'm sure it was not three -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
Hava-na-
As suicide remarks are torn -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
With no other choice except but for to go -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
Disconnect these cables--
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
How badly they were shocked -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Turn, turn, turn again -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
I a-hope you can hear--
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
I hope that you can hear--
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
It can't be this way everywhere -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
I see that stationmaster too.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Living down Sonora way.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Go lightly on the ground.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
In the pale moonlight.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
But you're never sure why you're here.
You know, I loved her just the same.
I'll only let you down.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Hope that it don't sleet.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Saying wants company.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
For your times, they are a-changing.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
In an oil refinery.
Even before you came in the door.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
To the old folks' home and the college.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Don't remember one thing more.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
The sooner you can leave.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
The sooner you can go.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
You're my baby.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
I always thought that he was well.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
In the border-towns of despair.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.

But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Crying out that he was framed.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.

Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
In the dark land of the sun.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
To the sin of love's false security.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
But she breaks just like a little girl.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Is gonna be against the law.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Watch the parking meters.

Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
People bending broken rules.

Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.

And clouds cover up the ground.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.

I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
The whole night through.
With an iron chain around his neck.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.

Than people who are most content.
To know which way the wind blows.

It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
Crumble into one another.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
We all know for sure that it's real.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
The country doctor rambles.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.

The National Guard stands around his door.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.

My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.

Your old road is rapidly aging.
And I was brought up by my brother.

Joking and talking about the world outside.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
Or define you or confine you.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.

'Cause he was a friend of mine.

Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
You got it, baby.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley - that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this-this is a song-this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
And guarded them as they fell.

She was the only daughter of the engineer.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Hope I don't blow it.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
And I need you, yeah.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Rain would gather too.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.

It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
"Don't point your finger at me.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
A true love of mine.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Ever since I seen her smile.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
And ye shall be changed.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
And I want you to be that woman.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.

Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
But I ain't neither one.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Honey, I want you.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
That last night I was with.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
Leave no stone unturned.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
Until I threw it all away.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
What's real and what is not.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
People sleeping in broken beds.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
I froze right to the bone.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
As if a wedding vow.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
You're a big girl all the way.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
I find it so difficult to leave.
And I'll rock you too.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Memories of what used to be.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
I's looking around just to see myself.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Some speak of the future.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
It'll never do, somehow.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Epitome, rigidity.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
To see what kinda words he could say.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Valentines can't buy her.
There's no words that need to be said.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Waiting on my burying ground.
And say you'll always let it be me.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
That which is not permanent don't last.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
Kisses she gave him three.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
To make me think I'm wrong.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Come on, darling.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Friends with you.
To anything I might have tried.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
He's the neighborhood bully.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
I know the kinds of things you like.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
That big, old boat started to sink.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Adios, mi corazon.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Some place so high above this wall.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Mortality, reality.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
I know you always say that you agree.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
My baby told me I would have to go.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Fighting every inch of the way.
I'll be your baby tonight.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
For there's a slow--said there's a slow, slow train coming.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
68, but says he's 24.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
From my toes up to my ears.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
I once held her in my arms.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Who says she knows me well.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
He's got his mother's eyes.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Leading me, going home.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Going through all these things twice.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
But I was raised on the other.
And make promises by the hours.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
All because of the color of his skin.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
You're drifting too far from shore.
New morning.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
But you were tangled up in blue.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
She acts like we never met.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
It hurts me, too.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
And relive my dreams.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
I'm just average, common too.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
You always got more than enough rope.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
In the brightness of my day.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
That's the way I remember her best.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
And she had left him to die in there.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Baby, please come home.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
You got a heart of stone.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
You're on the bottom.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Drink up your blood like wine.
So long, honey babe.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
If not for you.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Or stay all night with thee.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
What you'll say when you get home.
Take it on down to give me grow.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
My love, she speaks softly.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Oh, convey herself away.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Thanks.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
If it just don't make me hurts.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Honey, come and see about me.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Somebody better investigate soon.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Down along my restless palms.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Rain would gather, too.
When my memory is not so short.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Everything is broken.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
And try to avoid the scandals.
His mama sure was proud of him.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
You'll never see me frown.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
His voice was low with pain.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Going, going, gone.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
So many people I never saw in my life.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.

Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
People are expecting a false peace to come.

Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.

Few things you find are worthwhile.

My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.

The walls collide, Mona cries.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.

Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're-what you are but what you're not.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
I just go pump on it some.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
I know they're not what they seem.
Look a-the other way.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Try to avoid the scandals.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.

Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
And then unto eternity.
Far down the street we stray.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
The night will soon be gone.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Unless they're from another world.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
In the palace of the Pope.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.

It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Thought I was a communist.
Of every man who put me here.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
You're gonna need my help someday.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Just you and me.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Put me outta doors.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
And I'll go last.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
It can't be this way everywhere.
You don't have to be afraid.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a-a diamond as big as your shoe.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
To reach of your rattling drums.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Is just equality in school.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
So I beg you: let it be me.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
And one day he came passing by.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
You can make it too.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
And the sails are spread.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
While I'm in the hall.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
I can't fire them anymore.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
But these to tell what's true.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Well, I'm just thumping.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
That I left in the French Quarter.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Now and forever let it be me.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
But simply because it's true.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Humility, simplicity.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Our chances really was a million to one.
To anything I mighta tried.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
If you throw it all away.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
I just can't keep from crying.
The light I never knowed.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
And discovered her invisible self.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
I never saw the man again.
And you only got ten.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
And come away with me.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I'm ready when you are, Senor.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
No kindred or relative nigh.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
But with the country to where you're going.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.

The words that her lover had said.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.

Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.

Lord, your highway's getting filled.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Hmm, tell me.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.

Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
If you just let me come home with you.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.

Honey, I will pay your fare.

Bid farewell forever.
They seem determined to go all the way.

They don't make nothing here no more.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
Have fallen from her curls.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.

And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
But my heart just won't give in.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Into the land of the midnight sun.

You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
And the pearls are from Japan.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
You know the song in my heart.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Trying to create a next world war.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
At not getting their money's worth.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
And laid his life on the line.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
I'd be lost if not for you.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
It would go up against every rule.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Baby, baby.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
My baby stole my heart from me.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
And the night blows rainy.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
For she once was a true love of mine.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
When you made everybody pay.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
She murdered mortal he.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Like you never done before.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
But it was more than I could do.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I--but I just don't know how.
But I can't get close to her at all.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
I couldn't find any.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
You have no idea what you do to me.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
And left me here facing the wall.
With all these promises you left for me.
On this new morning with you.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Heart of mine.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
See like me or be like me.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
When you go your way and I go mine.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Broken voices on broken phones.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
I can't hear you anymore.
About an old man that never done wrong.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
I want you.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Calling out that he's been framed.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
And there's no time to think.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
What some people are gonna do for money.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
She saw her father's body broken.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
But the fighter still remains.
After losing every battle.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
For an instant hand touched hand.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Never will want for money.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
This kind of love, I-I'm lovesick.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
And she'll only know he's dead.
She pretends like we never have met.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
And it never seemed strange.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
And you must realize the danger.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
The whole world is my throne.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
I hope you're ready.
He ain't-a got no name.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Said it was a bad dream.
And no time to think.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
But, baby, please stop crying--it's tearing up my mind.
Havanageeluh.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Is tearing up your mind.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Last radio is playing.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
I'll hold it down for you.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Without ideals or violence.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
That number eleven was closing.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
Tried to create a next world war.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
The next day could be your last.
You're the only love I've ever known.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
I got trouble in my mind.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
I needed somebody to talk to.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
I just can't see through it anymore.
It don't matter anyhow.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
You'll do as much for me.
I only saw what they let me see.
Just what this song is all about.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
I remember her whispering yet.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Until my dying-day.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Just like you've always smiled before.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
That's the day you die.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
I've made shoes for everyone - even you - while I still go barefoot.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.

Dollar a day's worth.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
And your highway's getting filled.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.

Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
You're bound to fall" - you thought they were all kidding you.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Everybody that was hanging out.
By that soft and shining sea.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
I don't believe you.
They would not let me be.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.

Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
It was you who understood.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
My love winks, she does not bother.
You can say I didn't give to you.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
High society, notoriety.
Hmm.
Ever since I seen you there.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Just crying out that he was framed.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
There was nobody around.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Using ideas as my maps.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.

And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Blowing through another no-good town.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Mine alone.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
That can win what's never been won.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.

To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.

Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
As the present now will later be past.
To which a scoundrel clings.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
And I's left alone with three children.
But the mountains of the past.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
Under the hedges.
Trust yourself.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
With your golden loom.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
And watch the parking meters.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
If I ride back again.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
And crime don't have a face.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
I been in this thing too long.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
And light on your right knee.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Orders from the D.A.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
I said that.
You are on the bottom.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
At my window with a broken wing.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
Got my mind made up.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
She said she would always stay.
I just can't beg you anymore.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
It sure is right on a night like this.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Come on, baby.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
You won't get it for money.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Oh, yes, they did.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
'Cause I don't think about it.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
My mind is breaking.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Police at your back.
And you--you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Sweet lady.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
We were the wrong side.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
I'll remember you.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Till your error you clearly learn.
In my Cadillac.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
I got a bird that sings.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
I can't see through it anymore.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
Just like so many times before.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
It always does when you're with me.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Tangled up in blue.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
"Get well, get well," said she.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
He gone north for a while.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Everything is gonna be alright.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Trouble...
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
Nobility, humility.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
That just struck me kinda funny.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
See him at play makes me smile.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Rode slowly back again.
It was a normal day.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Thank you.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Yes, and I'll go last.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
And every window made of glass.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Behind a man's brain.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
68, but says she's 24.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
And get something quick to eat.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
And all I see are dark eyes.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
On the caboose of the train.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
With the glory that is to be.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
But I would never do you wrong.
Someone's watching over you.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
To anything I might've tried.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Evidently she won't.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
While my conscience explodes.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Lay dead beside him there.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
At the sorority sisters' home.
I'm a poet, I know it.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Where teardrops fall.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
But she had some way of finding them out.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
She's in some foreign land.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
May you stay forever young.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
I can't use it anymore.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
You can show me a new place to start.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.

Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
Everybody's having them dreams.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
That set everybody free.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Going back where we come from.
That old ship was a-going down.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Nobody stops to ask why.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Honey, I never would have come.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.

My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
I followed the winding stream.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
When she's better only time'll tell.
And each one I've never seen again.
With gold and silver in her hand.
The time and the place that we'd part.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.

There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Please quit your low-down ways.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
She can't find him anywhere.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Alright, thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Four by four they turn it some more.

All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Most of the time.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Chain you down or bring you down.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
And keep away from pranks.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.

Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
That keep us so tightly bound.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Till I come into New York town:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Man is opposed to fair play:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
But there's one promise, darling:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Serve somebody:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
His epitaph plain:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Had to be held down by big police;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Make promises by the hour;
So many things that we never will undo;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Some speak of the future;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Crumble into one another;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
I find complete love;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
All lies and jest;
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where are you tonight?
To love and follow His direction?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Who you thought you were talking to?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
How could they let you go?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
How's everything in heaven?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
And how does it feel?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Across the swamp of time?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Can you get back in?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Does anyone even try?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
How many more can they afford?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Baby, can't you tell?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Why would I want to take your life?
How many compared to yesterday?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
Have they missed you?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Just what in the world has come over you?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Before you call him a man?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Must everybody bow?
Don't you remember making baby love?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Across the swooping plain?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
How can I live for You?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Where did you hide your halo?
Where did you lose your wings?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
What's wrong with you this time?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
That too many people have died?
When did you leave heaven?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Too many people have died?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Does he change the course of rivers?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What can I give to You?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Has anybody seen my love?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Are you ready?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Of everything you see?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
What can I do for You?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
And one deserving of affection?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What would life be?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
How come you don't send me no regards?
How many more without any reward?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Before he can see the sky?
How does it feel?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Before they're forever banned?
For all these earthly things?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Before it is washed to the sea?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Gal, where you been so long?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Who killed Davey Moore?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
What do you think about that, my friend?
By golly, what more can I say?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Am I ready?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Just like a rolling stone?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Ready, George?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Can I come home with you?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Why and what's the reason for?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
How could they ever mistake you?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
I seen better times, but who has not?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Are you the same person that was here before?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Like a rolling stone?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
How much poison did they inhale?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
What else can a poor boy do?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Poor boy, where you been?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
What?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
When he's standing in front of you?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
What good am I?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Before he can hear people cry?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
And then you told me later as I apologized
For what you sold that's not been received
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
She let go of my hand
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
"Equality". I spoke the word
There ain't nothing in this world
And your trouble is you know it too good
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
I had to say something to strike him very weird
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Silvio, silver and gold
But now something has changed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
I've been walking around
Either from the mountains of Madrid
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I still can remember the way that you smiled
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Now, a very great man once said
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Now, whenever I get up and
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
So I'll make my stand
I thought that it was well-understood
The changes I was going through can't even be used
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
I want you, baby, just to understand
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Just what you had in mind
I will not go down under the ground
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Things would be different the next time we wed
By no special friend
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
And things would be different the next time we wed
Many times I've often prayed
To see him obviously framed
But she ain't gonna find the road
But all that suffering was not to be compared
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And those whom doom and death had spared
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Maybe someday you will understand
Standing on the water, casting your bread
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
As I stand upon the sand
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Now you don't seem so proud
We live in a political world
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
While some, on principles baptized
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Its iron claws attached
You used to be so amused
Now you don't act so--so proud
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
But something has changed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
And into the path you are hurled
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
How many times can a man turn his head
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And that even the nobles get properly handled
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Somebody seen him hanging around
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
You try so hard, but you don't understand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I'll always thank the Lord
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
You used--be so proud
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
It's something you did
I run right home and I went to bed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
All the sweethearts you can hold
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
They took a clean-cut kid
Nothing was delivered
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
I live in another world
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
He was a clean-cut kid
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
See the primitive wallflower freeze
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Looking at hands for the lines that were
At dawn my lover comes to me
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
On the rising curve
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
That she's the same one
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
And plenty time for good romance
Should I put them by your gate
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
"That I might be gone a long, old time
But it won't be over till they clear his name
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
When the rain is blowing in your face
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
You smiling through the fence at me
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Just what you will say when you get home
From the Golden Gate Bridge
They say don't come back no more
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
I do declare
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
The crashing waves roll over me
Remember me to the one who lives there
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Hunger pays a heavy price
She been gone
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Mona tried to tell me
You just pick anyone
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
If dogs run free, then what must be
The man the authorities came to blame
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And I would send a message
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
What's probably got you baffled more
Little did I realize
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
But I feel nothing for their game
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
What about that millionaire
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
You say you're looking for someone
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
I can survive and I can endure
It'll be with me unto the grave
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Taking care of somebody nice
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
You cut to the core
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
But the dark does die
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Says it's closing time
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
And I ain't complaining none
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
As he rises to fame
We see this empty cage now corrode
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
All I feel is heat and flame
Maybe someday you will look back and see
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
With all memory and fate
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Remember me to one who lives there
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
There were times when I was so lonesome
"It's only you that he does crave
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
When the roses fade
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
When Reilly's daughter got a message
So I remember every face
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
While them that defend what they cannot see
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
The cause was there before we came
So I look like a walking mountain range
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Should I leave them by your gate
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
He'll see by his grave
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
But I can't say I sympathize
Well, it's all new to me
Knows there's no success like failure
Though its shadow's metal badge
Waiting to find out what price
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
And never sat once at the head of the table
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
You said you'd never compromise
When I'm all alone
Con you into thinking that you're the one
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Limited in sex they dare
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
I'm ready for to fade
And that is that one must always flush out his house
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
I rode with him in a taxi once
Up into some paradise
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
To show you something you seen before
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I don't even notice she gone
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
To give the special one you seek a chance
If dogs run free, why not me
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
A bed that is never mine
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
From all the plans they do pursue
Among the lovely people living free
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
I been wondering all about me
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
And the Negro's name
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
She plunged him into well water where
So, I called up the operator of time
So up she picked her babies three
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
I'm sure you're the one to blame
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Full of hope and desire
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
And you see why it's so unique to be
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
How was I to know you'd be the one
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
You know, it's not even safe no more
But I can get another one
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Lies that life is black-and-white
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Just pick anyone
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
What good am I then to others and me
It's all new to me
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
If dogs run free, why not we
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
And I'm just the same as anyone else
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
You're not free to belong to me
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
From the start by the rule
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
You into thinking you're the one
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And suddenly there appeared before me
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Better stay away from those
And her silver-studded phantom cause
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
I am homeless, come and take me
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
How many ears must one man have
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
What you're gonna say when you get home
She knows there's no success like failure
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
'Cause the battle outside raging
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
But then a whistle will be blowing
They're drinking up and walking
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Well, I set my monkey on the log
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Where the time and the tempo drag
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
She rode by night and came by morning
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
What am I saying? What am I knowing
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
The order is a-rapidly fading
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
It's not a bad way to make a living
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
You left me standing in the doorway crying
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Deceived me into thinking
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
If I was with her too long
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Early in the morning, early in the morning
For your weary toes to be touching
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
The order is rapidly fading
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
And the cards are no good that you're holding
For your weary toes to be a-touching
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
The battle outside raging
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Beyond here lies nothing
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
There's nothing in here moving
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Then she told us how times were tough
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Girls' faces formed the forward path
You go north and you go south
And how I know I'll make it through
Look out, the saints are coming through
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
I have fallen far beneath
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You turn around to take a final peek
I wish she'd unlock
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
The man in me will do nearly any task
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Her voice once and talk
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Well, there ain't no going back
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Shoot in the back
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Make everything from toy guns that spark
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Ring bell, hard to tell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
And if my love is real
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Ring bar, hard to tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
How does it feel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
I chased me a woman up the hill
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
A girl by the whirlpool
Then why don't she tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Muttering small talk at the wall
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
He's taught in his school
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
All and all can only fall
Oh, how does it feel
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
How many seas must a white dove sail
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
They ask me how I feel
A-how does it feel
How many seas must the white dove sail
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
He's sure got a lot of gall
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Well, if I die on top of the hill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Two eyes took the aim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And remain as I am
But I can hear another drum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
You better not chew gum
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
"For you cannot relive them
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
All their daughters put me down
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
And she aches just like a woman
Well, you fake just like a woman
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Well, I'm hanging on
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Out of the shower comes a football man
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Trying to get a lead on
And the smell of their roses does not remain
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Must meet the dawn
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
And all their daughters put me down
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
To remember the times when I was your only man
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
But all their daughters put me down
She takes just like a woman
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
For the loser now will be later to win
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
He got that fortress on the mountain
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
But it's hard to think on
But the post office has been stolen
Guns and clubs followed him down
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
To my knowledge there's just one man
For the loser now might be later to win
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Poor boy in a red-hot town
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Have died in battle or in vain
"Not me," said the gambling man
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
As you sit on the box you keep him in
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
All lay down their bandanas and complain
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
But me, I expected it to happen
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
But the second mom was with the seventh son
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
From heights that they could not gain
And there's no exit in any direction
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Darkness at the break of noon
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And you ache a-just like a woman
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
My love, she's like some raven
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
I figure maybe we're even
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
That long, black train is pulling down
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
In ceremonies of the horsemen
In the pigpen
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
She said that all the railroad men
How can the life of such a man
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Somebody new to beat on
I don't even care if I ever see her again
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That long, black train is pulling on down
Why did you trade heaven
Advertising signs that con
Uncle Rat went running downtown
You don't need a weatherman
I'll be waiting at the station
Nothing we can call our own
The next morning she had awoken
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Yes, and someone must explain
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
A-she takes just like a woman
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
And she wakes just like a woman
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
You take just like a woman
Suicide remarks are torn
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
And the corner sign
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
The ones that jump on the wagon
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
She got such a sweet disposition
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Their religion of the little ten women
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
How many roads must a man walk down
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
But I swear I see my reflection
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
But the second mother was with the seventh son
You need something to make it known
All I'd like you to do
Silvio, I gotta go
All I really wanna do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
There's nothing you can say or do
There is a place you go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Every place I wanna go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Aladdin and his lamp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
How many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
What good am I while you softly weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Man in the coon-skin cap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
I walked down there and ended up
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
My ship is in the harbor
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Alone you stand with nobody near
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
For I am married to a house carpenter
The lover who has just walked out your door
When you whispered in my ear
The face of God will appear
I close my eyes and I wonder
In one I was running and in another
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
The wind howls like a hammer
You heard me saying a prayer for
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
Still I say her love-words over
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Still I've always kind of missed her
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
When only you are near
I could feel a whole lot better
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
At any moment you could go under
Who came here from Cuba's door
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
All you boys better run for cover
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
I say, "Why you say that for
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
So, don't fear if you hear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
But morning is clear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
For all eternity I think I will remember
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
She took him by his long, yellow hair
I don't have to go far
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
And I don't even think about her
Never no more do I wonder
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Now, you must provide some answers
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
With a big bouquet of the roses
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
You should be made to wear earphones
That it's you and no one else that owns
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
And, though the masters make the rules
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Statues made of matchsticks
You can fall down on your knees
I'm gonna let you pass
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
To sharpen the senses
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
True love can make a blade of grass
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
To the cutting of fences
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
People on the platforms
At times I think there are no words
Seven days
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And inside it with the people made of molasses
In the dimestores and bus-stations
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
They whisper in the wings
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Thinking of a series of dreams
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Girl by the whirlpool's
And tells me of her dreams
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Wants eleven dollar bills
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And then complains
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
People carry roses
Six-time users
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
You never turned around to see the frowns
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Glide across the lonely years
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Well, the ragman draws circles
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And so Patty calls the cops
To memorizing politics
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Don't follow leaders
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
The cowboy angel rides
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
I try to tell it like it is
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
What good am I if I say foolish things
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
With a fantastic collection of stamps
I let it slip gladly to my friends
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And the poor white remains
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
As friends and other strangers
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
But, though the masters make the rules
He's not selling any alibis
And the princess and the prince discuss
We living in times when men commit crimes
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And your father, to your sister he explains
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
I was thinking of a series of dreams
But still remains
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
The empty-handed painter from your streets
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Don't wear sandals
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You know that he has no intentions
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
How many deaths will it take till he knows
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Romantic facts of musketeers
I'd gladly confess
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
You been hurt so many times
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Six-time losers
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
And I try to harmonize with songs
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Good and bad, I define these terms
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Her window's wide open, African trees
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And without further notice asks you how it feels
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
He built a fire on Main Street
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Our Father would not like the way that you act
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
By the way, that's a cute hat
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Keep me set apart
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Yet you know there is no answer fit
We can hold up a toast if we meet
There's some people that
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Talking that the heat put
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
How many years can a mountain exist
In the precious winds they rot
Plants in the bed, but
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
Well, I finally started thinking straight
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Like a corkscrew to my heart
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
I'm on the pavement
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
You're gonna get hit
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
One more night the moon is shining bright
Everyone still talks about
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
I got into the driver's seat
And I, in my armor, turning about
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Johnny's in the basement
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Someday, everything is gonna be different
It don't take too long to find out
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
He really wasn't where it's at
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
In the stillness of the midnight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
But, if the arrow is straight
You're hearing my heart beat
They tell me revenge is sweet
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Everything is always right
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Keep it in your mind and not forget
You used to laugh about
And, since my feet are now fast
That might be all that you got
And the first one now will later be last
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
I think that it's best
The slowest now will later be fast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Wait for the morning light
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Oh, everybody's got to eat
They tell me to be discreet
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
The slow one now will later be fast
You used to laugh-make fun about
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Every new messenger bringing evil report
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
You don't forget
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
I soon get some rest
She seems too far out
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
How many years can some people exist
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
With your pockets well protected at last
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
One more night I will wait for the light
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
You are there in the flickering light
Ain't it hard when you discover that
So he never thinks straight
To hold each other tight
Without any doubt
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
I'm moving after midnight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
But, then again, there's only one I've met
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
I just might have to come see you
To protect you and defend you
It's just crazy being here with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I can be just like you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
And I tell this truth to you
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To be alone with you
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Ring them bells for the chosen few
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Don't it always go to show
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
The only one I know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Don't it always a-go to show
Down every street there's a window
With only you in view
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Well, I'd sure like to know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Sooner or later one of us must know
But sooner or later one of us must know
It only goes to show
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
I'd sure like to know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He been living there three years now
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
I did not do it harmfully
A cock is crowing far away
Don't you tell Henry
For them that must obey authority
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Went to the doctor the very next day
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Is worth more than I could pay
That I done it the way
Spouted out that liberty
And for His love they took His life away
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
But I can't deny
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
For them that think death's honesty
Or if you just want some company
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
How many times must the cannon balls fly
The Spanish-American War had its day
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
But I wish there was something you would do or say
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
If I don't take the chance to try
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
And the ladies treat me kindly
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Maggie says that many say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
So I run down most hurriedly
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And it's up to you to say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
And the only tune my guitar could play
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
To those condemned to act accordingly
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Though I'd never say
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
That I was just a puppet in a play
And that which you've given me today
She starts to speak, but he walks away
She knocked upon it anyway
I send you all my money
She smiles, walks the other way
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
So, I'm walking down your highway
My mind weaves a symphony
From phony jealousy
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
So they took him to the infirmary
She puts it to me plain as day
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
No, you'll not now or no other day
My ears hear a symphony
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
We banged the drum slowly
The same thing I would want today
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
For them that think death--death's honesty
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Well, I saw it advertised one day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
But you can never steal away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
