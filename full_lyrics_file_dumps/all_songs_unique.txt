All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Oh!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Woo-hoo!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
He punched me out!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Alright, now!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Alright!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
I ain't different than anyone!
I got the freight train blues!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Hootenanny television!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Play that guitar now!
You must think I'm crazy!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
I wanna be yours!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Well!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Yeah, man!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Betty Ross!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
She's insane!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Start over!
I'm in love with you!
They was all over!
They got away!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
I've got a million friends!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Take me down to California, baby!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
My God, they killed Him!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yes, come out your window!
Howdy, East Orange!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Thank you!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Oh, no!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Good God!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
It was the mailman!
Goodnight!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Oh, yeah!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
So long, New York!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Them Reds did it!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Dance!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Dignity never been photographed!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
How they ever flood my soul!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Woo!
I've got the freight train blues!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
Lordy, Lord!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
I figured they was in my TV set!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Yippee!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
I'll endow them onto thee."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
But I know what you want."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
It's all for the love of thee."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
And says, "Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
So write to her tenderly."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
He said, "Tell me about it."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
And have it on Highway 61."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
I'll bring back my lady."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
They look as dark as night."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
I love far better than thee."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Will mourn for your return."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Have it on Highway 61."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
I would want again tomorrow."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
God said, "On Highway 61."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Where you and I will unite."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Tangled up in blue."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
We want folksingers here."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
We'll both go home together."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
We'll both go off together."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Get on your horse and ride away."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Country'll grow."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
You can't blame us at all."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
And pretend that you never have met."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I can't find my knees."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You must know about my debutante."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And hung on a willow tree."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Come flowing down so free?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
I didn't see you around."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And punched my cigarette."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
That you must always first forgive them."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"Have you seen dignity?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I'll apply them all to thee."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
"That way down Highway 61."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
They look as white as snow."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
You can't blame me at all."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"Is it easy to forget?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
You and I'll never know."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
And keep him good company."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
From across that lonesome ocean."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
I want you,
In the great unknown,
Like you never did before,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Get born, keep warm,
Too serious to fool,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
There she come, now, down my way,
You have given me life to live,
When all will be well,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
In the lonely night,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Says he's got a bad bill,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
While paupers change possessions,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
God don't call it treason,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
And on the highway of regret,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
A true love of mine,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
And I don't want to drag you down,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
But, to remain as friends,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
God knows you've got to weep,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Who could they get to carry you,
She never does me wrong,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
To stay closer than any friend,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Front door shut, back door too,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
They don't believe in mercy,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
I can't understand,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
And also by his feet,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Searching everywhere I know,
And you take just like a woman,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Waiting for the trains,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
If anything is gonna sell,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Without ideals or violence,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
If she ain't feeling well,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Up and down the block,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
I just can't beg you anymore,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
To be out on your own,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Winter would have no spring,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I think we better talk this over,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
We live in a political world,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Spent my money on you, honey,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
But it ain't him to blame,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
So glad,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
"Come along and take a trip,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Tell me,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
See you fly or watch you die,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
In the instant that I preach,
If'n you don't know by now,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
They tell me every man must fall,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
He won't do nothing to you,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
I try my best to be just like I am,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Oh, watered-down love,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Corrina, Corrina,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Never did feel this way before,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Like a rolling stone,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
When there is no more,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
And I know what you're thinking of,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
And here I sit so patiently,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And point away from the past,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
All I really wanna do,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
In a pine box for all eternity,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
It don't matter what you did,
The Second World War came to an end,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Precious memories, how they linger,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
You will be alright, girl,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Thinking about the government,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
She leave by the other and roam,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I been good while I been waiting,
I went into the city, into the town,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Says he's got a bad cough,
You even make love just like a woman,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
They say every man needs protection,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
To hide 'neath a hood,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Nothing too very scientific,
I found my world, found my world in you,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
But I know that he don't talk,
But you were gambling for support,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Yet every distance is not near,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Ain't no going back,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
You have given me eyes to see,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
To shine in through,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
To be alone with you,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
You better chew gum,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Broken lines, broken strings,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
By rivers of blindness,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Father of minutes, father of days,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
But it would not be new,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
But, deep inside my heart,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Father of day, father of night,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Icicles hanging down,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Four by four, no illusion for,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Get back, write Braille,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
You married young just like your ma,
You'll be doing society a favor,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
They say every distance is not near,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Don't let me change my heart,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
A dream about you, baby,
It always has hit me from below,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
They say every man must need protection,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
You can run down to the desert,
You wanna drown love,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
He's young and on fire,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Strike another match, go start anew,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
We've killed each one,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Simplify you, classify you,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
To know how much I really care,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I ain't looking to block you up,
By users, cheaters,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
That fellow who never blushes,
Searching high, searching low,
Face full of black soot,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
God knows it's fragile,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
And there's two white horses following me,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Stripping away at it all,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
I'm gonna let you pass,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
They say everything can be replaced,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
I shall be released,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
And played the fife lowly,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
If you can't quit your sinning,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
We'll fly the night away,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
My dear, sweet friend,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I had a dream about you, baby,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
He's not selling any alibis,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Well, I'm pressing on,
It's not aimed at anyone,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
If you'd see me this way,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Every moon is so sanctified,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
I try my best to be like I am,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Advertising signs, they con,
God don't call it wrong,
You and me, we had completeness,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Oh, see what you can do,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Carved next to his name,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
The joint is jumping,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Heart of mine, be still,
You could look at it and weep,
But now morning is clear,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
To a solid rock,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
I'll go see them come down my way,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Love don't have any place,
Thank You, Lord,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I got those worried blues,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Just like I did before,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Madams light the candles,
To be without a home,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Of this I can't say very much,
A thousand miles from home,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Without your sweet love,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Give you my money, honey,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
But ye shall be a-changed,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Father of loneliness and pain,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
I tried to reach you, honey,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Eh, singing just for you,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Aim well, my little one,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
And I got those worried blues,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
He's the property of Jesus,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Watered-down love,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
In love and with kindness,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Every head is so dignified,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Father who build the mountain so high,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Just then the order came to charge,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Like a dog on a chain,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
As his youth now unfolds,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Don't let me drift too far,
The day would surely have to break,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Since you've been gone,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
For the wise men and the fools,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Tears on the letter that I write,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
For his age he is wise,
I thank the Lord,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
You need something to open up a new door,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Bring the wife and family,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Better jump down the manhole,
If your time to you is worth saving,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Father of air and father of trees,
If I didn't have to guess,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
New morning,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I like the way that you move your hips,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
It was you who came right through,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
That can do what's never been done,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
I got no place left to turn,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
In the little church a-this side of town,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
God knows it's terrifying,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
God knows there's a heaven,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Watch the river flow,
Made before the foundation of the world,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
You can raise up your right hand,
He been around the world and back again,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
My love, she speaks softly,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
You have given everything to me,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
But you try with your whole soul,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
It hurts me, too,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
I just don't know what to do,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
A handle hid out in the dark,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
To protect his white skin,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
That one doctor cannot save him,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Don't let yourself fall,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Baby, please stop crying,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
I've been in and out of happiness,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Made of silver or of golden,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
I never can go because, you know,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
And I got the worried blues,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
To be on your own,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Far away from it all,
Well, I may just swear,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
God knows it's outta sight,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
In his anger and his shame,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Stand up straight and tall,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
And, if I can save you any time,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Said I'm pressing on,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
And furnish me with tape,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I know I can't win,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
At the close of the day,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
She's opened up a happy home,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Don't let her hear,
Puffing on a big cigar,
But the bottles are done,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
And to come every time you call,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Don't let her know that you love her,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
It was a girl I learned it from,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
My arms and legs were broken,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Go away from my window,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
My limbs are shaking,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Out to the windy beach,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
One by one they followed the sun,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
I had so much left to do,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Look out, kid,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
With his fist in a clinch,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Need a woman all the time,
If ever I prove false to you,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
In the hills of mystery,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
And gathering storms may arise,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I'm so glad,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
China doll, alcohol,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Laying low,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Mercury, gravity,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
But something has changed,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
And think they're fooling you,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Paradise, sacrifice,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
All the silver, all the gold,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
I won't have my nature way,
That two healers cannot heal him,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I'd only have to stay,
Relationships of ownership,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
All them prophets good and gone,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
God knows it's a crime,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
You'll change your last name, too,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
When you think that you've lost everything,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
May be living in another country under another name,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Broken switches, broken gates,
With the juice running down my leg,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
I bless the day I found you,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Mixing up the medicine,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
And your streets are getting empty,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
The night would see me wide awake,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Go melt back in the night,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
But I'm saved,
Under the microscope,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
You had enough of hatred,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
May be an actor in a plot,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Staying far behind without you,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
I got a wife and five little children,
The wind howls like a hammer,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Somewhere down the road some day,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
But, if you want me to,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
There's always someone who understands,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
When I seen him lose control,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
I can finish this alone, honey,
They keep it all hid,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
People going down to the ground,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
You better duck down the alleyway,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Joey, Joey,
God knows when,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Don't follow leaders,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Looking 'bout the government,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Just don't know what to do,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Look away, you rolling river,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Every brain is civilized,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
You got to serve somebody,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Memory, ecstasy,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
The carpet too is moving under you,
At ships with tattooed sails,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
But, if you ride back and I am left,
And I––I walk out on my own,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
A million faces at my feet,
How he died nobody could say,
Don't tie no bows,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Hmm, see what you can do,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
I'm never, never far from home,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
The train leaves at half past ten,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
One by one they follow the sun,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
I can see the turning of the key,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
I can't cross the line, you know,
And I'm just like that bird,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Eh, see what you can do,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
I got my mind made up,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
They––they show me to the door,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Automobile coming into style,
Got me a secret membership card,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
All the tired horses in the sun,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Saved,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
And, if I see the day,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Now, lamp-gates and <i>[incomprehensible]</i>, I can recite 'em all,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And you make love just like a woman,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Light yourself a candle,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
It's a price I have to pay,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
You need something to open your eyes,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Dream about you, baby,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
And she aches just like a woman,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Precious father, loving mother,
That the laws are with him,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Why she did go,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You want watered-down love,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Just like a rolling stone,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Going home,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
And not going through any great extreme,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Go down to the river, babe,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
People talk over situations,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Stone you when you are young and able,
And, if anybody asks me,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Don't ever try to change me,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
God knows there's a river,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
For something that he never done,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
I'd give you the sky high above,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
To be so useless and all,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
I don't care if you feel like me,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
To keep up his hate,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Where life and death are memorized,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
I can make it through,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Try to be a success,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Three angels up above the street,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
In one the surface was frozen,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
For all intended purposes,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Over the hills and far away,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Father of night, father of day,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
But I'm pressing on,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Pressing on,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Day you quit me, baby,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Get dressed, get blessed,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
The sky too is folding over you,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
The country music station plays soft,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Gonna serve somebody,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Heart of mine,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Going,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Everything's a-hers or his,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Serve somebody,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Carry the New York Times,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
May you stay forever young,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
It still ain't me, babe,
They say every man need protection,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
And ye shall be a-changed,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
To be––direction home,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
I'd already gone the distance,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
It's alright,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
King of the streets, child of clay,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
This world is ruled by violence,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
When she lays upon the grass,
I been good,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
You don't have to feed me,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Tell me that you love me only,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
They say that every man must fall,
Loyalty, unity,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Get jailed, jump bail,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Seven days,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
God knows everything,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Stay away from the train line,
I've been around this whole country,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
One more night the stars are in sight,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And give him back the time he's done,
To have––be on your own,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
If today was not a crooked highway,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Forever young, forever young,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
On this new morning, new morning,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Equality, liberty,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
But I would not feel so all alone,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Is looking for a new fool,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
People talk of situations,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Hang around the ink-well,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
God knows there's a chance,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Looking for a new fool,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
In the ruins of your balcony,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
As the present now will later be past,
Someone to open each and every door,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
It could even be like a myth,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
I want my arms around you,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
He got that soft, silky skin,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
No, nothing was delivered,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
That you'd have liked me to,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
And she makes love just like a woman,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
More people kept a-piling on,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
If not for you,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Friends with you,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
When the night comes falling,
God knows you ain't pretty,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Make you spin or do you in,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
I went into the red, went into the black,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Got my mind made up,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Better jump down a manhole,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Going, going,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
But it ain't me, babe,
And you know I could never be your own,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Loneliness, tenderness,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
The day you quit me, baby,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Beating for the dead that rise,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
To strict party-platform ties,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Read books, repeat quotations,
The haunted, frightened trees,
The wind blowing the snow around,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
I'll be on my way,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
The country doctor rambles,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
With what your fate is going to be,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Don't try No Doz,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
God knows there's a purpose,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
It was from her ship sailing,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Far away in the stormy night,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
True love, they've been without it,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
It's like I ain't here,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Father of black, father of white,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
From their fates try to resign,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Adiós, mi corazón,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
You don't want a love that's pure,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
How many a year has passed and gone,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Speaking to some French girl,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Keep a clean nose,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
My senses have been stripped,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Don't you tell Henry,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
She'll surely turn to white,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Grandpa died last week,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
We take great delight in our own company,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Like a complete unknown,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
"Not me," said his manager,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
They say every man must fall,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
When God and man will be reconciled,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
I got two white horses following me,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
And the whole world is on your case,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
I get my sweet reward,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Well, I been gambling so long,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Look who's back in town,
Going, going, gone,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Is it really any wonder,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Well, the job that you used to have,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
"Not I," said the referee,
The sky too is folding under you,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
The angels play on their horns all day,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Never weak, but always strong,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Oh, Angelina,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Is used, it is plain,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Without a love of my own,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Broken threads, broken springs,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I can't be good, baby,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Well, I'm so glad,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
God knows how to make it flow,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
You're beautiful to me,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Just to know that you are near,
Six months on the chain gang,
Like some mystery,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
The air is getting hotter,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
True love of mine,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Went back home to the yard,
I'm leaving today,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
My woman needs it every day,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Too noble to neglect,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Tell her not to worry,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Drag you down or drain you down,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
I like the cool way you look at me,
A hand set the spark,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
From now on this'll be where you're from,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
My love, she speaks like silence,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Never needed to call you my whore,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
But, if I can save you any time,
She once was a true love of mine,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Try hard, get barred,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Had no one to go my bail,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
You got something I want plenty of,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
And come every time you call,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
You to me were true,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
And forget my pride,
I'm going out of my mind,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Don't let her see,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I wish tonight were here,
I rambled out of New York town,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
God knows it's true,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Far past the frozen leaves,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Don't let yourself stumble,
And may you stay forever young,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
God sees it all unfold,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Not the end, not the end,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
You stole her love from me one day,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Trust yourself,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Couldn't even see the floor,
The night passed away so quickly,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
The winter would hold no spring,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Badge out, laid off,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
The light I never knowed,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
You have explained every mystery,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
And I'm so glad,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
As human gods aim for their mark,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Two by two they step in the dark,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
You were striped, you were plain,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Rabbit running down across the road,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
God knows it's a struggle,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
I can change, I swear,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
She would have married me,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
This situation can only get rougher,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
I'd be sad and blue,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Thieving in the alley,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
But I've been hanging on,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
But the time ain't tall,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
One by one until there were none,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Don't wear sandals,
How does it feel,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
She said she would never forget,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
If you throw it all away,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
The man in the trench-coat,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
The only son of God Almighty,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Where I will always be renewed,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Each one playing a horn,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
And pretend that we never have touched,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And, although that we're single and free,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
For the politician's gain,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
You're beautiful beyond words,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Or have done something wrong,
Of ancient history,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
So, never leave me lonely,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
On the stone that remains,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
It always means so much,
All you can do is do what you must,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
That fired the gun,
And the point is slick,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
To find out if she's talked,
I'm going down the river,
With his candle lit into the sun,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
When I was in Missouri,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
You gotta look some other place,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Using every angle under the sun,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Baby, let me follow you down,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
For her to arrive,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Want you,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
And I'm in the shade,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
But you're doing it again,
Or select you or dissect you,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
If you must cling to someone,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
In the end,
God knows that, when you see it,
And it ain't me, babe,
But he can't be blamed,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Wintertime in New York town,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Want you so bad,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
And rivers that ran through every day,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Every nerve is analyzed,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
In the darkness of my night,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
You can hear them tires squeal,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Ever since I been a child,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Private reasons, great or small,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
The beat is pumping,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
And he just smoked my eyelids,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
But evidently she don't,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
And it's like I ain't here,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
In the turning of twilight,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Vanished from my hand,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
I want you so bad,
Just remember that death is not the end,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
I need a shot of love,
Ye shall be changed,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
The one we can see and can feel,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Keep me where you are,
How he died nobody can say,
You have given all there is to give,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Giving back all of what you owe,
You've got to serve somebody,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
It's really something,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Like as not, it's better so,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I just keep pressing on,
To gather flowers constantly,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I should have left this town this morning,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
But, if I will save you the time,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Stone you and say good luck,
Circled by the circus sands,
She got great big hind legs,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
A man named Martin Luther King,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Watching the river flow,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Alright, I'm so glad,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
And, though the line is cut,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I just don't see why I should even care,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
It's too bad he had to go,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
By losers, cheaters,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
I long to see you in the morning light,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
That can do what's a-never been done,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I got a bird that whistles,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
People carry roses,
So I got those worries blues,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
That her father was going to hang,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Pick you up every time you fall,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Over your senses you have no control,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Drifting too far from shore,
Love that's pure no accident,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
You made it there somehow,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
And joined the John Birch Society,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
I been riding the midnight train,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Can't find what I need,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
I threw it all away,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Father of cold and father of heat,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
That must be what it's all about,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
They must bust in early May,
She said she would always stay,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Makes no difference where she's been,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Silvio, I gotta go,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
A man with a badge skips by,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Resent him to the bone,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
While riding on a train going west,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Who will promise never to part,
Each time we meet, love,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
He is centuries old,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
How many times have you heard someone say,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
You were snow, you were rain,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
That foreign sound in your ear,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
With a killer's pride, security,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Oh, singing just for you,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
And she'll be coming forth,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
And I'm back in the rain,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
The kingdoms of experience,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
And to come each time you call,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
She'll be coming forth,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
The phone's tapped anyway,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
They took a clean-cut kid,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
They lowered him down as a king,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Far away and over the wall,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
The Communists was a-coming around,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
You got something better,
Ten thousand men on the move,
First degree and second degree,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
It's rising up above my head,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
And ride a horse along the trail,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
For she ain't the same,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Don't let her know,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
You follow, find yourself at war,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Precious angel under the sun,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
To your tambourine in time,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
If you'd see me this a-way,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Watch the plain-clothes,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Well, get sick, get well,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Without a dream in my heart,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
My hands can't feel to grip,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Don't matter what you did,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
So unknown,
I just say no thanks,
I have no one to meet,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Eh, in somebody's room,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Strangers all give me the news,
And every cause that ever I fought,
To hang and to lynch,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Someone to close his heart,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Trouble,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Come all without, come all within,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Well, well, well,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
With no direction home,
I would not feel so all alone,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
I got the worried blues,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Ooh, watered-down love,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
I once held her in my arms,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
"The news of the day is on all the time,
I fell down to my bended knees,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
A complete unknown,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Nothing was delivered,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Democracy don't rule the world --
That's where you belong --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
Just what this song is all about.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
There were six thousand people there.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Ever since we've been apart.
Rain would gather, too.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
But it was more than I could do.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And that failure's no success at all.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
That old ship was a-going down.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
To kill with no pain.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
My love winks, she does not bother.
And I'll go last.
You know the song in my heart.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Nobility, humility.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
And tapestry of rhyme.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
In my Cadillac.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
All of your <i>[incomprehensible]</i> and let's talk about your soul.

Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.

And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
I believe I'm fixing to die.

I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.

Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Looking for the places only they would know.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.

My face you'll never see no more.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Just like so many times before.

Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.

Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.

Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
In an oil refinery.

Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Like you never done before.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Most of the time.
And discovered her invisible self.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
The National Guard stands around his door.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
If you throw it all away.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
But my heart just won't give in.

I'd like to know.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
You're my baby.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
And ye shall be a-changed.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Who says she knows me well.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
He's got his mother's eyes.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Try to avoid the scandals.
I been in this thing too long.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
When my working day's through.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
It don't matter, anyhow.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
You're a big girl now.
Remember, before you come, at least please first telephone.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Waiting on my burying ground.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
If you won't come out your window.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Everybody's having them dreams.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I said that.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Go find out something only dead men know.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
"And light on my right knee.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
What looks like the easy way out.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
If'n you don't know by now.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Or put up against the wall.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
But you're never sure why you're here.
And ye shall be changed.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Come on, baby...
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Going back where we come from.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
There's a guy I gotta see.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Yes, tell me.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
In the night the price was paid.
Watch the parking meters.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
The sooner you can leave.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
For an instant hand touched hand.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.

I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
I can't shoot them anymore.
For your times, they are a-changing.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
You're my honey.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Some speak of the future.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Thought I was a communist.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
And there's no time to think.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
It can't be this way everywhere.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
The same as my father before him.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
Have fallen from her curls.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
And the people that confronted him were many.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Got to have done some evil deed.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Havanageeluh.
To keep her from the howling winds.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
That last night I was with.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Oh, Angelina.
Last radio is playing.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
It runs both cold and deep.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
That's the day you die.
Everything is broken.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Crumble into one another.
She just acts like we never have met.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Blood on your saddle.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
And then go on home and have my fun.
That set everybody free.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Some place so high above this wall.
And relive my dreams.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Well, I saw you making love with him – you forgot to close the garage door.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
While my conscience explodes.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
And each one I've never seen again.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Slowly into autumn.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
As if a wedding vow.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Got my mind made up.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Soft as music, light as spring.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
I got nothing left to burn.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Headed out for the western skies.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Someone I really could care for.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
When I'm alone with you.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
I'll remember you.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
You're drifting too far from shore.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
She's in some foreign land.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
Hmm.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Living down Sonora way.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Honey, I want you.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
That which is not permanent don't last.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
I want you.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
His mama sure was proud of him.
They don't make nothing here no more.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
I don't even know why we come.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
At the sorority sisters' home.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
And all your raging glory.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Just to take somebody's money away.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
To reach of your rattling drums.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Hope that it don't sleet.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
You break your promise all over the place.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
I will only let you down.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
An innocent man in a living hell.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
And gives it to me for a song.
I don't know.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Tell me.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Orders from the D.A.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But all I see are dark eyes.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
In the border-towns of despair.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
It was all over by a quarter past.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
God knows...
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
Good as I been to you.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
She murdered mortal he.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
But you break just like a little girl.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
Mortality, reality.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
They found him dead in the street one day.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
And come away with me.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
You know, I loved her just the same.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
He's the neighborhood bully.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Got ice water in my veins.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
You to me were the best.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Bring that bottle over here.
Step lightly on the ground.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Going, going, gone.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
I seen a man.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And disregards the rest.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I long to reach for you in the night.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.

Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.

And passion rules the arrow that flies.

I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
And shot it fulla holes.
All because of the color of his skin.
Without ideals or violence.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.

Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Nobody stops to ask why.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Until I threw it all away.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
It was you who understood.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
To hold me in your arms.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Under the hedges.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Leading me, going home.
That just struck me kinda funny.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Wasn't any difference to me.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
In this concrete world full of souls.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Dollar a day's worth.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
With all these promises you left for me.
Lay dead beside him there.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
To know which way the wind blows.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Find out something only dead men know.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
It always does when you're with me.
Everybody must get stoned.
Epitome, rigidity.
You give something up for everything you gain.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
I'd give anything to be with you.
What you'll say when you get home.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
Patriotism, materialism.
Than people who are most content.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Unless they're from another world.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
As the present now will later be past.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
To be alone with you.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
In the dark land of the sun.
For the times, they are a-changing.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.

Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.

And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
See him at play makes me smile.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
And she had left him to die in there.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
We all know for sure that it's real.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
He's always on trial for just being born.
And it never seemed strange.
The place that I started from.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Blues wrapped around my head.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
I just can't do what I done before.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Reality has always had too many heads.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
And one day he came passing by.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
You can say I didn't give to you.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
She can't find him anywhere.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
That big, old boat started to sink.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
They want me for a gambling fight.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Even before you came in the door.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
So long, honey babe.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Some place so high above the wall.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
I just can't beg you anymore.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Crying out that he been framed.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Baby, please come home.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
While the law looks the other way.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Hope you're ready.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
He could die happily ever after.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
A true love of mine.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
I see that stationmaster too.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Father of love and father of rain.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Chain you down or bring you down.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
The sooner you can go.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
But the fighter still remains.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
If you just let me come home with you.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Madams light the candles.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Bid farewell forever.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
So quickly into autumn.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
And I've never been too impressed.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Where I was born and partly raised.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
But, mama, you been on my mind.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
If not for you.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
People bending broken rules.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
And I'll rock you too.
I been worrying about you, baby.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Baby, two feet from the well.
You left me standing out in the cold.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
But he sure left here in style.
I can't fight them anymore.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
To anything I mighta tried.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
To anything I might have tried.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
With an iron chain around his neck.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
Saying wants company.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
I got nothing to go back to now.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a, a bone.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot".
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
I want everybody to be free.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Just you and me.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
In the palace of the Pope.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
About an old man that never done wrong.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
I'm just average, common too.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Billy, you been running for so long.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Oh, her darling love she found.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
I got a bird that sings.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
You are on the bottom.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
I couldn't find any.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Life don't mean a thing.
You don't have to be afraid.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Someone's watching over you.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Buildings going up to the sky.
While evening slips away.
He ain't-a got no name.
In the pale moonlight.
Six by six...
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
But I ain't got Corrina.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The hour when the ship comes in.
And keep away from pranks.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
You sound like a hillbilly.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Hope I don't blow it.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
And the mailbox is locked.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
When you go your way and I go mine.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
See like me or be like me.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
I hope I'm ready.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
In fond memory appear.
I can't use it anymore.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
I froze right to the bone.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Greenwich Village.
After losing every battle.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Without a love of my own.
People sleeping in broken beds.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.

Drifting too far from shore.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Yeah, serve somebody:
But there's one promise, darling:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
His epitaph plain:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Till I come into New York town:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:

You'll be grand at the end of the line:

Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Man is opposed to fair play:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Serve somebody:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
About everybody that was hanging out;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Crumble into one another;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
All lies and jest;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Everybody that was hanging out;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
I find complete love;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Make promises by the hour;
Had to be held down by big police;
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Some speak of the future;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;

After he's taken everything that he can steal?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
To love and follow His direction?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Across the swooping plain?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Just like a rolling stone?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Of everything you see?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Where did you lose your wings?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Can you get back in?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Why and what's the reason for?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Baby, can't you tell?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
How's everything in heaven?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Before he can hear people cry?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
The love that a stranger might receive?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Have they missed you?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Before you call him a man?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
What else can a poor boy do?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Are you ready?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Before they're forever banned?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Where did you hide your halo?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Why would I want to take your life?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
By golly, what more can I say?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
And how does it feel?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Am I ready?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
How many more can they afford?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Across the swamp of time?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
How could they let you go?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Is it rolling, Bob?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Does anyone even try?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Oh, so why not you and me?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Before he can see the sky?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Does he change the course of rivers?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Can I come home with you?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
I seen better times, but who has not?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
And one deserving of affection?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
When he's standing in front of you?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
That too many people have died?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Are you the same person that was here before?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
How could they ever mistake you?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Like a rolling stone?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
How does it feel?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
How much poison did they inhale?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Am I still dreaming yet?
For all these earthly things?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Too many people have died?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
How many paths did they try and fail?
How many compared to yesterday?
How many more without any reward?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Gal, where you been so long?
What would life be?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
All the sweethearts you can hold
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
And those whom doom and death had spared
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
And then you told me later as I apologized
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
So I'll make my stand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
For what you sold that's not been received
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Silvio, silver and gold
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
It's something you did
By no special friend
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
While some, on principles baptized
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And things would be different the next time we wed
Many times I've often prayed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Now, a very great man once said
The changes I was going through can't even be used
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
How many times can a man turn his head
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
I live in another world
Now you don't seem so proud
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Things would be different the next time we wed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Its iron claws attached
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Maybe someday you will understand
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
But all that suffering was not to be compared
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
She let go of my hand
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
"Equality". I spoke the word
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
You try so hard, but you don't understand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
I run right home and I went to bed
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
You used to be so amused
I've been walking around
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Now, whenever I get up and
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
I thought that it was well-understood
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I'll always thank the Lord
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
You used––be so proud
Now you don't act so––so proud
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
I will not go down under the ground
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
To see him obviously framed
They took a clean-cut kid
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
We live in a political world
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
He was a clean-cut kid
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
I had to say something to strike him very weird
But she ain't gonna find the road
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
But now something has changed
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
I want you, baby, just to understand
Then came the warning that was before the flood
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Nothing was delivered
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
There ain't nothing in this world
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
And into the path you are hurled
Just what you had in mind
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Somebody seen him hanging around
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Either from the mountains of Madrid
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And your trouble is you know it too good
As I stand upon the sand
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Looking at hands for the lines that were
"It's only you that he does crave
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
At dawn my lover comes to me
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Though its shadow's metal badge
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Just what you will say when you get home
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Taking care of somebody nice
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
She been gone
Remember me to one who lives there
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Says it's closing time
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Hunger pays a heavy price
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Lies that life is black-and-white
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I don't even notice she gone
Leaving men wholly, totally free
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
If dogs run free, then what must be
The man the authorities came to blame
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
But it won't be over till they clear his name
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
You said you'd never compromise
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
When the rain is blowing in your face
They say don't come back no more
When the roses fade
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Waiting to find out what price
You know, it's not even safe no more
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
What's probably got you baffled more
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Limited in sex they dare
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Maybe someday you will look back and see
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Just pick anyone
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
On the rising curve
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Everybody's wearing a disguise
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
You into thinking you're the one
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
How was I to know you'd be the one
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
It's getting dark, too dark to see
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
I been wondering all about me
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
I rode with him in a taxi once
Remember me to the one who lives there
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
A bed that is never mine
A girl who would murder her own, true love
He'll see by his grave
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Well, six white horses that you did promise
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Why wait any longer for the one you love
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
It's all new to me
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
And plenty time for good romance
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
So I look like a walking mountain range
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
So I remember every face
Knows there's no success like failure
But I can get another one
Most of the time I can't even be sure
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
And I'm just the same as anyone else
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
See the primitive wallflower freeze
That she's the same one
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
I do declare
To show you something you seen before
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
How many ears must one man have
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
We see this empty cage now corrode
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And you see why it's so unique to be
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
There were times when I was so lonesome
And never sat once at the head of the table
While them that defend what they cannot see
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
From the Golden Gate Bridge
She plunged him into well water where
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
When I'm all alone
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
So, I called up the operator of time
It'll be with me unto the grave
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Should I leave them by your gate
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
What about that millionaire
You're not free to belong to me
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
But I can't say I sympathize
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
And I ain't complaining none
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Full of hope and desire
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
She knows there's no success like failure
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
The cause was there before we came
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
And suddenly there appeared before me
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
You just pick anyone
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Up into some paradise
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
But the dark does die
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
What good am I then to others and me
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
To give the special one you seek a chance
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
If dogs run free, why not me
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
The crashing waves roll over me
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Should I put them by your gate
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
From the start by the rule
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If dogs run free, why not we
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
But I feel nothing for their game
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
I am homeless, come and take me
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Where I could watch her waltz for free
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
I can survive and I can endure
Con you into thinking that you're the one
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
I'm sure you're the one to blame
And the Negro's name
And I would send a message
Little did I realize
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
As he rises to fame
All I feel is heat and flame
So up she picked her babies three
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
From all the plans they do pursue
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
You say you're looking for someone
Among the lovely people living free
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Better stay away from those
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
You cut to the core
Mona tried to tell me
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
For your weary toes to be touching
I can hear their hearts a-beating
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Where the time and the tempo drag
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
The order is a-rapidly fading
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Well, I set my monkey on the log
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the cards are no good that you're holding
She rode by night and came by morning
There's nothing in here moving
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
It's not a bad way to make a living
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
What am I saying? What am I knowing
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And there's no telling who that it's naming
For your weary toes to be a-touching
They're drinking up and walking
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
But then a whistle will be blowing
You left me standing in the doorway crying
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
'Cause the battle outside raging
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
If I was with her too long
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
The battle outside raging
The order is rapidly fading
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Deceived me into thinking
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And how I know I'll make it through
You go north and you go south
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Then she told us how times were tough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I have fallen far beneath
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Look out, the saints are coming through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
The man in me will do nearly any task
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
I wish she'd unlock
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Well, there ain't no going back
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
You turn around to take a final peek
Shoot in the back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Her voice once and talk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
But they caught him and they brought him back
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Then why don't she tell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Ring bar, hard to tell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
A girl by the whirlpool
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
As the last fire-truck from hell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
How does it feel
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
To make all that should be killed to crawl
All and all can only fall
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
And if my love is real
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
How many seas must the white dove sail
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
But among the dead that were left on the hill
They ask me how I feel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
How many seas must a white dove sail
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
A-how does it feel
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Oh, how does it feel
Muttering small talk at the wall
I chased me a woman up the hill
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
He's sure got a lot of gall
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
He's taught in his school
And remain as I am
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
But I can hear another drum
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You better not chew gum
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Two eyes took the aim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
"For you cannot relive them
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
So, one morning when the sun was warm
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And you ache a-just like a woman
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Guns and clubs followed him down
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
In the pigpen
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
You take just like a woman
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Will not be understood as they're spoken
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
She takes just like a woman
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
The ones that jump on the wagon
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
You don't need a weatherman
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Out of the shower comes a football man
Must meet the dawn
All their daughters put me down
Well, I'm hanging on
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
He got that fortress on the mountain
Yes, and someone must explain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
A-she takes just like a woman
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Their religion of the little ten women
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
But the second mom was with the seventh son
The next morning she had awoken
You need something to make it known
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
But it's hard to think on
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
To remember the times when I was your only man
And all their daughters put me down
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Suicide remarks are torn
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And she wakes just like a woman
But me, I expected it to happen
Well, you fake just like a woman
Why did you trade heaven
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
My love, she's like some raven
That long, black train is pulling down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Have died in battle or in vain
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Please don't let on that you knew me when
And she aches just like a woman
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
But the post office has been stolen
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
To my knowledge there's just one man
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I don't even care if I ever see her again
She said that all the railroad men
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
That long, black train is pulling on down
For the loser now might be later to win
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
From heights that they could not gain
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
She got such a sweet disposition
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Yet I swear I see my reflection
But I swear I see my reflection
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
In ceremonies of the horsemen
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
I'll be waiting at the station
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
But all their daughters put me down
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I figure maybe we're even
How many roads must a man walk down
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Somebody new to beat on
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Trying to get a lead on
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
And the corner sign
As you sit on the box you keep him in
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Advertising signs that con
Uncle Rat went running downtown
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Darkness at the break of noon
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
And there's no exit in any direction
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
"Not me," said the gambling man
How can the life of such a man
For the loser now will be later to win
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
All I'd like you to do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
It's very nice to stay a week or two
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
There is a place you go
Silvio, I gotta go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
There's nothing you can say or do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Every place I wanna go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
All I really wanna do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
What good am I while you softly weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
I walked down there and ended up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Aladdin and his lamp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The man in the coon-skin cap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
How many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
The lover who has just walked out your door
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
The wind howls like a hammer
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
I say, "Why you say that for
So, don't fear if you hear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
For I am married to a house carpenter
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
At any moment you could go under
She took him by his long, yellow hair
All you boys better run for cover
For all eternity I think I will remember
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The face of God will appear
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
I could feel a whole lot better
And I don't even think about her
Who came here from Cuba's door
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
When you whispered in my ear
Alone you stand with nobody near
But morning is clear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
In one I was running and in another
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Never no more do I wonder
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Still I've always kind of missed her
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
I close my eyes and I wonder
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
When only you are near
I don't have to go far
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Still I say her love-words over
You heard me saying a prayer for
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Her window's wide open, African trees
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And I try to harmonize with songs
But still remains
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And inside it with the people made of molasses
You know that he has no intentions
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
You never turned around to see the frowns
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
At times I think there are no words
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And, though the masters make the rules
Romantic facts of musketeers
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
He's not selling any alibis
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
To memorizing politics
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Good and bad, I define these terms
As friends and other strangers
And without further notice asks you how it feels
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
True love can make a blade of grass
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
People on the platforms
I'm gonna let you pass
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And then complains
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Six-time losers
The cowboy angel rides
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
And the princess and the prince discuss
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Glide across the lonely years
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Girl by the whirlpool's
Six-time users
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
With a big bouquet of the roses
But, though the masters make the rules
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
And tells me of her dreams
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
You can fall down on your knees
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And the poor white remains
On the back of the fish truck that loads
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
You should be made to wear earphones
How many deaths will it take till he knows
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
When your mother sends back all your invitations
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Don't follow leaders
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
They whisper in the wings
Don't wear sandals
"Not me," said the man whose fists
I'd gladly confess
To the cutting of fences
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
We living in times when men commit crimes
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Thinking of a series of dreams
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
People carry roses
You been hurt so many times
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
I try to tell it like it is
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Wants eleven dollar bills
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
What good am I if I say foolish things
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And so Patty calls the cops
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
In the dimestores and bus-stations
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Seven days
And your father, to your sister he explains
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
That it's you and no one else that owns
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I was thinking of a series of dreams
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Well, the ragman draws circles
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
The empty-handed painter from your streets
To sharpen the senses
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Now, you must provide some answers
Statues made of matchsticks
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Keep it in your mind and not forget
How many years can some people exist
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
He built a fire on Main Street
Everything is always right
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Everyone still talks about
And, since my feet are now fast
They tell me revenge is sweet
How many years can a mountain exist
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
One more night the moon is shining bright
I think that it's best
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
I got into the driver's seat
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
I soon get some rest
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
But, if the arrow is straight
Talking that the heat put
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
They tell me to be discreet
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
You don't forget
The slow one now will later be fast
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
To keep it in your mind and not forget
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I'm on the pavement
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
He really wasn't where it's at
We can hold up a toast if we meet
By the way, that's a cute hat
You used to laugh–make fun about
So he never thinks straight
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
That might be all that you got
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
And I, in my armor, turning about
Wait for the morning light
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
To hold each other tight
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
You're hearing my heart beat
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Keep me set apart
You are there in the flickering light
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
One more night I will wait for the light
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
In the precious winds they rot
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
With your pockets well protected at last
And the first one now will later be last
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the stillness of the midnight
She seems too far out
Well, I finally started thinking straight
You used to laugh about
Plants in the bed, but
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Someday, everything is gonna be different
There's some people that
Yet you know there is no answer fit
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
You're gonna get hit
Johnny's in the basement
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
The slowest now will later be fast
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
It don't take too long to find out
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Without any doubt
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Oh, everybody's got to eat
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I can be just like you
And I tell this truth to you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
It's just crazy being here with you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To be alone with you
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
I just might have to come see you
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To protect you and defend you
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
With only you in view
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
It only goes to show
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
The only one I know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Don't it always go to show
Well, I'd sure like to know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Sooner or later one of us must know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
But sooner or later one of us must know
Don't it always a-go to show
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
I'd sure like to know
He been living there three years now
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
So, I'm walking down your highway
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But I can't deny
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
So they took him to the infirmary
If I don't take the chance to try
The same thing I would want today
The Spanish-American War had its day
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And it's up to you to say
And for His love they took His life away
That I done it the way
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Well, I saw it advertised one day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Is worth more than I could pay
But you can never steal away
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Maggie says that many say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Or if you just want some company
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
I send you all my money
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
A cock is crowing far away
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
For them that think death––death's honesty
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
And I'm leaving every day to run away
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Spouted out that liberty
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
And the ladies treat me kindly
No, you'll not now or no other day
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
And the only tune my guitar could play
For them that think death's honesty
For them that must obey authority
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
We banged the drum slowly
He made the bells of freedom ring today
I did not do it harmfully
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
My mind weaves a symphony
So I run down most hurriedly
Though I'd never say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And that which you've given me today
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Went to the doctor the very next day
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
How many times must the cannon balls fly
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Don't you tell Henry
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
My ears hear a symphony
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
She puts it to me plain as day
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
She smiles, walks the other way
To those condemned to act accordingly
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
But I wish there was something you would do or say
She knocked upon it anyway
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
That I was just a puppet in a play
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
From phony jealousy
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
I a-hope you can hear––
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Leave all the children home –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
As suicide remarks are torn –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
It's just a ragged clown behind –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
First degree and second degree –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I hope that you can hear––
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
To know where you are –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Havana–gee–
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Disconnect these cables––
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
You will not hear a laugh –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Havanagee–luh–
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
I long to hold you in the night –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Ha–va–
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Private reasons – great or small –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Oh, my–
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Remember me to one who lives there –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Hang out the whole next day –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
I got no idea what I want –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Indians camp along her border –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
I'm sure it was not three –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Hava–na–
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Turn, turn, turn again –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Haven't seen her since that night –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
With no other choice except but for to go –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Whispering your secret emotion –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
That can win what's a-never been won –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
How badly they were shocked –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
