She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Woo-hoo!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!

He punched me out!
Alright!
My God, they killed Him!
I figured they was in my TV set!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
Play that guitar now!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Yippee!
Woo!
Lordy, Lord!
Thank you!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!

I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
I've got a million friends!
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Tangled up in blue."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
I'll apply them all to thee."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
And hung on a willow tree."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
They look as white as snow."
They look as dark as night."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
And punched my cigarette."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
I didn't see you around."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
I can't find my knees."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I love far better than thee."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
And keep him good company."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"That way down Highway 61."
I would want again tomorrow."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Would kill a little bird like me."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
You and I'll never know."
Come flowing down so free?"
And have it on Highway 61."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
God said, "On Highway 61."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
And it's all for the love of thee."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
We'll both go off together."
You must know about my debutante."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
For that reason I will have to stay."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
You can't blame me at all."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
That you must always first forgive them."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
And pretend that you never have met."
I'll endow them onto thee."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Where you and I will unite."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
We want folksingers here."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
We'll both go home together."
I'll bring back my lady."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
You can't blame us at all."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
So write to her tenderly."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Have it on Highway 61."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Country'll grow."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
But I know what you want."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Will mourn for your return."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
He said, "Tell me about it."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Has kindly assisted me home."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
It's all for the love of thee."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
I've been around this whole country,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
By users, cheaters,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
And played the fife lowly,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I shall be released,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
And I don't want to drag you down,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
My love, she speaks softly,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Look out, kid,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Mixing up the medicine,
I love you, pretty baby,
Of this I can't say very much,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
That they do not respect in any degree,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Try to be a success,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
They don't believe in mercy,
But I would not feel so all alone,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Wintertime in New York town,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
But he's the property of Jesus,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
You got something I want plenty of,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
I want you,
With his fist in a clinch,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
And they––they look at me and frown,
The man in the trench-coat,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
I wish tonight were here,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Seem like I been down this way before,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Over the hills and far away,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Come all without, come all within,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
God knows that, when you see it,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
But you were gambling for support,
The wind blowing the snow around,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Come on, come on, stick together,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
So, never leave me lonely,
Tears on the letter that I write,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
In the end,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
I landed up on the downtown side,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Pick you up every time you fall,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Thank You, Lord,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Like a rolling stone,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I try my best to be like I am,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
The Second World War came to an end,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
And you take just like a woman,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
I'm going back to Colorado,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
The kingdoms of experience,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Every moon is so sanctified,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
If you can't quit your sinning,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
One summer's day he came passing by,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Three angels up above the street,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
To know how much I really care,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Stand up straight and tall,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
To stay closer than any friend,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
God sees it all unfold,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Like a dog on a chain,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Who could they get to carry you,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Is looking for a new fool,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Had no one to go my bail,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
I got the worried blues,
You say my kisses are not like his,
And point away from the past,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
It was from her ship sailing,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
The air is getting hotter,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
A thousand miles from home,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Memory, ecstasy,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I had a dream about you, baby,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Every head is so dignified,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
We take great delight in our own company,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Thieving in the alley,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I threw it all away,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
How does it feel,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Look who's back in town,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
To hang and to lynch,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
My senses have been stripped,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Without ideals or violence,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
They say every man needs protection,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
God knows there's a chance,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
You'll change your last name, too,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
By rivers of blindness,
And not going through any great extreme,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
That you'd have liked me to,
You wanna drown love,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
The night blows cold and rainy,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Don't let yourself fall,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Loneliness, tenderness,
A complete unknown,
I'm so glad,
For all intended purposes,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Yet every distance is not near,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
I'm leaving today,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Private reasons, great or small,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Don't let her see,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
It always has hit me from below,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
If she ain't feeling well,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
That five walls cannot hide him,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
I went back home, put on my tie,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
For her to arrive,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Each time we meet, love,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Roll, Willie, roll,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Never did feel this way before,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
The light I never knowed,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, I may just swear,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Watered-down love,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Without a dream in my heart,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Staying far behind without you,
In the little church a-this side of town,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Fare thee well but for a while,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
And all of your children start to resent you,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
True love, they've been without it,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Hang around the ink-well,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Now, won't you tell me true,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
In the darkness of my night,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
I can see the turning of the key,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Without a love of my own,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
But the bottles are done,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Don't follow leaders,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
We'll fly the night away,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
May you stay forever young,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
It was you who came right through,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
You need something to open up a new door,
To your tambourine in time,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Keep a clean nose,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Baby, please stop crying,
I'll be on my way,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
And it still ain't me, babe,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Went back home to the yard,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Oh, Angelina,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
You want watered-down love,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I got no place left to turn,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
God knows there's a heaven,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Someone to open each and every door,
And furnish me with tape,
May be an actor in a plot,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
For she ain't the same,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
I'd already gone the distance,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Spent my money on you, honey,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
I'm going down the river,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Father of black, father of white,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
God knows how to make it flow,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
God don't call it wrong,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Trouble,
I need a shot of love,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
God knows there's a river,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
I'd only have to stay,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Precious angel under the sun,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
She would have married me,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
And the point is slick,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
The man there said he loved my sound,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
We live in a political world,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
If anything is gonna sell,
God knows it's a crime,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
The country doctor rambles,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Strangers all give me the news,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Going home,
Ain't no going back,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
And you make love just like a woman,
Maybe when we both get sober,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
God knows you've got to weep,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
But you're doing it again,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
And I got the worried blues,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
I been good while I been waiting,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Over your senses you have no control,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
They say every man must fall,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
She'll surely turn to white,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Simplify you, classify you,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
So unknown,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Grandpa died last week,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Waiting for the trains,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Face full of black soot,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
But you try with your whole soul,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
I'm never, never far from home,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Give you my money, honey,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Well, I'm pressing on,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Hmm, I can make it through,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Well, I'm so glad,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Where I will always be renewed,
That fired the gun,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
You better chew gum,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
You don't want a love that's pure,
The wind howls like a hammer,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She's opened up a happy home,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Went to the station down in the yard,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
A dream about you, baby,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
You to me were true,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
See you fly or watch you die,
You even make love just like a woman,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
It's like I ain't here,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
New morning,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Don't know what to do without it,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Beating for the dead that rise,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Want you,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Six months on the chain gang,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
God knows it's terrifying,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
People going down to the ground,
Or select you or dissect you,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Like some mystery,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
The sky too is folding under you,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
To be out on your own,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
I got two white horses following me,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
All I really wanna do,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Paradise, sacrifice,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
And your streets are getting empty,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
But, if you want me to,
God knows it's outta sight,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Well, there ain't no going back,
No direction home,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
When all will be well,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
You could look at it and weep,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
In the lonely night,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Just like I did before,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Everything's a-hers or his,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
"Not I," said the referee,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Stone you just like they said they would,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
And, though the line is cut,
Why she did go,
She said she would never forget,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Stay away from the train line,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
If'n you don't know by now,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
All that and more and then some,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Nothing was delivered,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
But, deep inside my heart,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Precious father, loving mother,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Ye shall be a-changed,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
That the laws are with him,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Drifting too far from shore,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Where mercy walks the plank,
I'd be sad and blue,
And it's like I ain't here,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Father of loneliness and pain,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Eh, see what you can do,
God knows there's a purpose,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
I been good,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
If not for you,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Somewhere down the road some day,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
It's rising up above my head,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
God knows everything,
Well, I been gambling so long,
If ever I prove false to you,
And, although that we're single and free,
They say everything can be replaced,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
And here I sit so patiently,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Too noble to neglect,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
God knows it's true,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Get back, write Braille,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
And the whole world is on your case,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I got those worried blues,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
I went into the city, into the town,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
One by one until there were none,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
With the juice running down my leg,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Winter would have no spring,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Tell me that you love me only,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
To hide 'neath a hood,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
They run a brick and tile company,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I just don't know what to do,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
And I'm back in the rain,
Two by two they step in the dark,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Don't try No Doz,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Each one playing a horn,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
She once was a true love of mine,
Nothing too very scientific,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
And I'm so glad,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
You have given everything to me,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
And to come every time you call,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Just like a rolling stone,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Badge out, laid off,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Serve somebody,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Who will promise never to part,
Relationships of ownership,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
You can raise up your right hand,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Up and down the block,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
I had no one for to go my bail,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
I can't be good, baby,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Father of minutes, father of days,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Never needed to call you my whore,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Well, the way I love that woman,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Madams light the candles,
And there's two white horses following me,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
To be––direction home,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Don't let me change my heart,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Stone you and say good luck,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
If I didn't have to guess,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Searching high, searching low,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Like a complete unknown,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
And she aches just like a woman,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Love don't have any place,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
So I got those worries blues,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
China doll, alcohol,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
In one the surface was frozen,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
In the instant that I preach,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Far away in the stormy night,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
But something has changed,
Resent him to the bone,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Icicles hanging down,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
The winter would hold no spring,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
You have laid down Your life for me,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Corrina, Corrina,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
You're beautiful beyond words,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Eh, singing just for you,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
I long to see you in the morning light,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I get my sweet reward,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
And also by his feet,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
And you know I could never be your own,
This situation can only get rougher,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Father of air and father of trees,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
God knows when,
That can do what's never been done,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
I thank the Lord,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
It still ain't me, babe,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
To be alone with you,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
I don't care if you analyze me,
God don't call it treason,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
With no direction home,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
You made it there somehow,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
From their fates try to resign,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
You've got to serve somebody,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
He's young and on fire,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Well, I gave you all my money,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
All the silver, all the gold,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
God knows it's fragile,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
I would not feel so all alone,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
You have given me eyes to see,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
At ships with tattooed sails,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Under the microscope,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
People talk over situations,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
I went out last night to take a little round,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
But the time ain't tall,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
I went into the city, went into the town,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
It don't matter what you did,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
I found my world, found my world in you,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
When the night comes falling,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Can't find what I need,
To be on your own,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
While paupers change possessions,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Watch the river flow,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
When I seen him lose control,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Someone to close his heart,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
If you throw it all away,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Oh, singing just for you,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Since you've been gone,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Oh, see what you can do,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
If you must cling to someone,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
I don't care if you feel like me,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
And may you stay forever young,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
You can run down to the desert,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
It's really something,
And ride a horse along the trail,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Without your sweet love,
That fellow who never blushes,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Don't you tell Henry,
You have given me life to live,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
There's always someone who understands,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
She never does me wrong,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Or have done something wrong,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
You have explained every mystery,
Where the neon madmen climb,
You and me, we had completeness,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
You will be alright, girl,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Look away, you rolling river,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
As the daylight hours do increase,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
And, if I can save you any time,
Far away from it all,
She'll be coming forth,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
My love, she speaks like silence,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
They say every distance is not near,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
To find out if she's talked,
And forget my pride,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Mercury, gravity,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
My arms and legs were broken,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
She leave by the other and roam,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Drag you down or drain you down,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
But, to remain as friends,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
If you'd see me this a-way,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
My existence led by confusion boats,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
For his age he is wise,
Light yourself a candle,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Some things are too hot to touch,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
I can finish this alone, honey,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Our conversation was short and sweet,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Makes no difference where she's been,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Who among them would try to impress you,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Father of day, father of night,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
This world is ruled by violence,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Friends with you,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Don't let her know,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
They keep it all hid,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
The country music station plays soft,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
You had enough of hatred,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
God knows it's a struggle,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
By losers, cheaters,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
You can stick your head in the sand,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
And it's only that I'm asking,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
I can't cross the line, you know,
The sky too is folding over you,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Don't tie no bows,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Looking 'bout the government,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I got a bird that whistles,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Well, I can't understand,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
It was a girl I learned it from,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
That four ears cannot hear him,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
The joint is jumping,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
May be living in another country under another name,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I can make it through,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
They walk among the stately trees,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Never weak, but always strong,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
He is centuries old,
He been around the world and back again,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I went down to scrub and rub,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
I got a wife and five little children,
But evidently she don't,
I'd give you the sky high above,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
She got great big hind legs,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Trust yourself,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
No, nothing was delivered,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
And gathering storms may arise,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Silhouetted by the sea,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Most of the time it's well understood,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
To shine in through,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Speaking to some French girl,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Already the fiesta has begun,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
I think we better talk this over,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
On this new morning, new morning,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Saved,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
I rambled out of New York town,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
For something that he never done,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Oh, watered-down love,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I can't understand,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
You don't have to feed me,
Not the end, not the end,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Analyze you, categorize you,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
The only son of God Almighty,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
It hurts me, too,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I can change, I swear,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
He's the property of Jesus,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
To strict party-platform ties,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Well, get sick, get well,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Hold me, baby, be near,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I wish I a-was a magician,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
A handle hid out in the dark,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
How he died nobody can say,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
All the tired horses in the sun,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Want you so bad,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
And I got those worried blues,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Go melt back in the night,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
People carry roses,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Got me a secret membership card,
But I'm pressing on,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
I've been all around the world, boys,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
With what your fate is going to be,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
I won't have my nature way,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
You need something to open your eyes,
Day you quit me, baby,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Out to the windy beach,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
In the turning of twilight,
And come every time you call,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
My woman needs it every day,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
There she come, now, down my way,
Name of Martin Luther King,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
All you can do is do what you must,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
They must bust in early May,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Judge and jury took their stand,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Looking for a new fool,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Human gods aim for their mark,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
I should have left this town this morning,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
You were snow, you were rain,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Try hard, get barred,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
You have given all there is to give,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Socialism, hypnotism,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Searching everywhere I know,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
In a pine box for all eternity,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Aim well, my little one,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
But I've been hanging on,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
In another I witnessed a crime,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Ever since I been a child,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
And she'll be coming forth,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Get jailed, jump bail,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
And rivers that ran through every day,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
That must be what it's all about,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
And, on their promises of paradise,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Circled by the circus sands,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Just remember that death is not the end,
The beat is pumping,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Heart of mine,
And, if anybody asks me,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Said I'm pressing on,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
When she lays upon the grass,
While riding on a train going west,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Stone you when you are young and able,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Carry the New York Times,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Yes, I'm so glad,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
It's alright,
Far away and over the wall,
Too serious to fool,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
When I was in Missouri,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
All them prophets good and gone,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
One by one they follow the sun,
Just then the order came to charge,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Made before the foundation of the world,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
That her father was going to hang,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Don't let her hear,
She said she would always stay,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
I know I can't win,
In the great unknown,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
My dear, sweet friend,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
They took a clean-cut kid,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
For the wise men and the fools,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
To be one your own,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
And it ain't me, babe,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Tell her not to worry,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
They––they show me to the door,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
You always responded when I needed your help,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Like you never did before,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
You married young just like your ma,
I have no one to meet,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
With his candle lit into the sun,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Using every angle under the sun,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Going, going, gone,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
The night passed away so quickly,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Going,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I want my arms around you,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
When there is no more,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Dust on my face and my cape,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
To gather flowers constantly,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
You got something better,
To have––be on your own,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
I bless the day I found you,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Father of night, father of day,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Laying low,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
More people kept a-piling on,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Ye shall be changed,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
How he died nobody could say,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
They say every man must need protection,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
To protect his white skin,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
But it ain't me, babe,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
I ain't looking to block you up,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Well, come all without, come all within,
But now morning is clear,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I just keep pressing on,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Heart of mine, be still,
Get born, keep warm,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Strike another match, go start anew,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
The day would surely have to break,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
It's a price I have to pay,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
They pass by so silently,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
You got to serve somebody,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Every brain is civilized,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Forever young, forever young,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
In the shadows of moonlight,
But, if I can save you any time,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
If you'd see me this way,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
I just say no thanks,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
The day you quit me, baby,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Is it really any wonder,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Into my own parade,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
The one we can see and can feel,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Made of silver or of golden,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
You're beautiful to me,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
One by one they followed the sun,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Just to know that you are near,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
But it would not be new,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Going, going,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
With a killer's pride, security,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
But I know that he don't talk,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
And think they're fooling you,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
They say that every man must fall,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
You stole her love from me one day,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
It always means so much,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Bring the wife and family,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Make you spin or do you in,
Better jump down the manhole,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Far past the frozen leaves,
That one doctor cannot save him,
It all seemed so well-timed,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
The Communists was a-coming around,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And I'm just like that bird,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Equality, liberty,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Ooh, watered-down love,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Whether you are right or wrong,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Four by four, no illusion for,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Joey, Joey,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
I never can go because, you know,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Love that's pure no accident,
They say every man need protection,
I'm going out of my mind,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
"Not me," said his manager,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
But I'm saved,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
I've been saved – well, alright,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Precious memories, how they linger,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, well, well,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
And I'm in the shade,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Living in the land of Nod,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Advertising signs, they con,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
You'll be doing society a favor,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
My limbs are shaking,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Automobile coming into style,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Honey, I will meet you there,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
I got my mind made up,
Thinking about the government,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
In the hills of mystery,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
But, if I will save you the time,
A man with a badge skips by,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Stripping away at it all,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Front door shut, back door too,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
To a solid rock,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
That long, black train is pulling down,
One more night the stars are in sight,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
And on the highway of regret,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
At the close of the day,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Where life and death are memorized,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
On the stone that remains,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I had so much left to do,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
A hand set the spark,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Only one thing I did wrong,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
And to come each time you call,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I been riding the midnight train,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Yes, and I'll go last,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
The night would see me wide awake,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
To keep up his hate,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Carved next to his name,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Watching the river flow,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
I want you so bad,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
And give him back the time he's done,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
I just can't beg you anymore,
He's not selling any alibis,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Just don't know what to do,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Don't matter what you did,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
"Come along and take a trip,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Of ancient history,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Three by three they're turning the key,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Like as not, it's better so,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Seven days,
Broken lines, broken strings,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Well, I don't mind dying,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
You gotta look some other place,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Till both of us fell by the way,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
A million faces at my feet,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Better jump down a manhole,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Is used, it is plain,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Keep me where you are,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
I like the cool way you look at me,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
True love of mine,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Go down to the river, babe,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
To be so useless and all,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
But it ain't him to blame,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Got my mind made up,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And, if I see the day,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
And I know what you're thinking of,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
They lowered him down as a king,
Don't let me drift too far,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
For the politician's gain,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
But he can't be blamed,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Get dressed, get blessed,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Don't put yourself over the line,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
It's too bad he had to go,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Don't let her know that you love her,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Don't ever try to change me,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
As the present now will later be past,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Pressing on,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Gonna serve somebody,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
I'm gonna let you pass,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Dream about you, baby,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
It could even be like a myth,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
In his anger and his shame,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Need a woman all the time,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
I fell down to my bended knees,
He won't do nothing to you,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Father who build the mountain so high,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
They tell me every man must fall,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
To be without a home,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
You were striped, you were plain,
I once held her in my arms,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Vanished from my hand,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
So glad,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Don't wear sandals,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
People talk of situations,
We've killed each one,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Tell me,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
In love and with kindness,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
In the image of someone you used to know,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Loyalty, unity,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
A true love of mine,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
First degree and second degree,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Go away from my window,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
As his youth now unfolds,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Democracy don't rule the world --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
That's where you belong --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Figuring a way to get back home.
And pretend that we never have touched.
All because of the color of his skin.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
May you stay forever young.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Ever since I seen you there.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
That old ship was a-going down.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Waiting on my burying ground.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Walking around with no one else.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Patriotism, materialism.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
With the golden loom.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Under the midnight moon.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
That's the day you die.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Lay dead beside him there.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
My baby took my heart from me.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Most of the time.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
To keep her from the howling winds.
A-lord, protect my child.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
That number eleven was closing.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Life don't mean a thing.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Orders from the D.A.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
While my conscience explodes.
So many people I never saw in my life.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Just like so many times before.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Oh, Angelina.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
I been worrying about you, baby.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
If you won't come out your window.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
And your golden loom.
That Johanna's not here.
In the border-towns of despair.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
And each one I've never seen again.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Someone's watching over you.
Blowing through another no-good town.
And time is beginning to crawl.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
To make me think I'm wrong.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
The National Guard stands around his door.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
You can show me a new place to start.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
She pretends like we never have met.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
But you break just like a little girl.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.

It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
He's got his mother's eyes.
Hear me singing through these tears.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
I's looking around just to see myself.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.

Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.

Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
She just acts like we never have met.
That which is not permanent don't last.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
He's the neighborhood bully.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Mama, you been on my mind.
His mama sure was proud of him.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
I had something to protect.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Leave no stone unturned.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Using ideas as my maps.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
It was all over by a quarter past.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
She once was a true love of mine.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
They found him dead in the street one day.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
And your highway's getting filled.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
They got – all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
You got a heart of stone.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.

More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
Mary wore three links of chain.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
I'd like to know.
Four by four they turn it some more.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Up and down the lonesome town.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
You're a big girl all the way.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
Thought I was a communist.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Who says she knows me well.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
I hope I'm ready.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Your son is coming back from the war.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Please let me ride you home.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
From the little Minnesota town.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Where I was born and partly raised.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
I have heard rumors all over town.
I'll hold it down for you.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
I long to reach for you in the night.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Headed out for the western skies.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
But you're not even sure what it is.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Crying out that he was framed.
If I ride back again.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
In the palace of the Pope.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
The sooner you can go.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
To which a scoundrel clings.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
And all I see are dark eyes.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
To hold me in your arms.
She can't find him anywhere.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
To reach of your rattling drums.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Never will want for money.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
But the fighter still remains.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
But I ain't got Corrina.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
To be alone with you.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
It'll never do, somehow.
That I left in the French Quarter.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Mine alone.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
It's just the old American way.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
I can walk anytime around the block.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
Going, going, gone.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
In the dark land of the sun.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
While I'm in the hall.
Is what this thing here is for.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
I would only let you down.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
That linger in the fireball heat.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
You break your promise all over the place.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Lord, protect my child.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
She murdered mortal he.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
When he played and we didn't dance.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Got my mind made up.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
Take it on down to give me grow.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
And there's no time to think.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
Looking for a new friend.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Said it was a bad dream.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.

Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
Like you never done before.

A .44 smokeless under my head.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.

Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.

That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
I never saw the man again.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.

Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
She's in some foreign land.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
With the glory that is to be.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.

The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.

If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.

And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Bid farewell forever.

Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.

But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
To the old folks' home and the college.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
And watch the parking meters.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.

And I want you to be that woman every time.
And I'll rock you too.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.

Drifting too far from shore.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
He gone north for a while.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
I got a bird that sings.
Ever since I seen her smile.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
My face you'll never see no more.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.

Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Trust yourself.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
A true love of mine.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
I got nothing left to burn.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
To anything I might've tried.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Fear to bring children into the world.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
When you go your way and I go mine.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Six by six...
You know the song in my heart.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
That brave and devoted band.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.

The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
To anything I might have tried.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Neighborhood bully.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.

He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
After losing every battle.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
God knows...
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
You may not see me tomorrow.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Rain would gather, too.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Kisses she gave him three.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
And gives it to me for a song.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
But I can't get close to her at all.
I see that stationmaster too.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
Honey, I never would have come.
I'm just average, common too.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Where teardrops fall.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
I seen a man.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Epitome, rigidity.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.

Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
You can make it too.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
That set everybody free.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
You'd better get that in your head.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
But the mountains of the past.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Far down the street we stray.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
I see better days and I do better things.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Join the army if you fail.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
If you throw it all away.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Funny way to start a picnic.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
And rivers that ran through every day.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
As if a wedding vow.
What looks like the easy way out.
Go find out something only dead men know.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Step lightly on the ground.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
He never did know what it was all about.
I once held her in my arms.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Going back where we come from.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
And wait for succeeding kings.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
I need a shot of love.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Even before you came in the door.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
And left me here facing the wall.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
I know something is changed.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
To anything I mighta tried.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
See like me or be like me.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
I froze right to the bone.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
I did not do it knowingly.
And the night blows rainy.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Means another poor boy is underground.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
In fond memory appear.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
But simply because it's true.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
And clouds cover up the ground.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
I always thought that he was well.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
Now and forever let it be me.
Behind a man's brain.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
What's real and what is not.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Sweet lady.
Come on, baby...
And they were both out on Highway 61.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
Some place so high above the wall.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Some place so high above this wall.
Try to avoid the scandals.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
No kindred or relative nigh.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
Hope I don't blow it.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
Drink up your blood like wine.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
But it was more than I could do.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Someone I really could care for.
Billy, you been running for so long.
At my window with a broken wing.
That can win what's never been won.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Suffering like a fool.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
But that's what I am paid to do.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Everything is broken.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
Know not what the years may hold.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Even the softest touch.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
When my working day's through.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
For an instant hand touched hand.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Look a-the other way.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Oh, her darling love she found.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
The same as my father before him.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
You're on the bottom.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Have fallen from her curls.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
She saw her father's body broken.
The light I never knowed.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Girls like birds fly away.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
From my toes up to my ears.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
And the sails are spread.
I don't know.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
I shall be released.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Hope you're ready.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
You left me standing out in the cold.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
"And stay all night with me.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
But you're back where you belong.
I find it so difficult to leave.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
And one day he came passing by.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
And ye shall be changed.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Watch the parking meters.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
When my memory is not so short.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
And I need you, yeah.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Baby, two feet from the well.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
I just can't keep from crying.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
My baby stole my heart from me.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Rain would gather too.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
He went down to Oxford Town.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
I followed the winding stream.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Duality, mortality.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
I remember her whispering yet.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
But all I see are dark eyes.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Don't remember one thing more.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
They don't make nothing here no more.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Until my dying-day.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Tell me.
Tangled up in blue.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I know they're not what they seem.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Go lightly on the ground.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Honey, I want you.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
Put me outta doors.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
And come away with me.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Crying out that he been framed.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Going through all these things twice.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
On the caboose of the train.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
And relive my dreams.
They both rode off together.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Father of love and father of rain.
I hate bears.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
He ain't-a got no name.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Sound like it's on a final run.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Leading me, going home.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
See him at play makes me smile.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Everything is gonna be alright.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Nobility, humility.
Just what he was talking about.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
With all these promises you left for me.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
His epitaph plain:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
But there's one promise, darling:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Serve somebody:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Till I come into New York town:
Make promises by the hour;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
I find complete love;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Had to be held down by big police;
So many things that we never will undo;
Crumble into one another;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Some speak of the future;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
All lies and jest;
About everybody that was hanging out;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<p>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
And one deserving of affection?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What's wrong with you this time?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
And how does it feel?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
That too many people have died?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Too many people have died?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Before you call him a man?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Just what in the world has come over you?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
I seen better times, but who has not?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
How many more can they afford?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Gal, where you been so long?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Across the swamp of time?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Who killed Davey Moore?
What would life be?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
What can I give to You?
Can you get back in?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Like a rolling stone?
Of everything you see?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
How much poison did they inhale?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Before he can hear people cry?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
To love and follow His direction?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Just like a rolling stone?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many more without any reward?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Is it rolling, Bob?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Does anyone even try?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Has anybody seen my love?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Baby, what more can I tell?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
How does it feel?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Where did you lose your wings?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Are you ready?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Baby, can't you tell?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Where did you hide your halo?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Why would I want to take your life?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Oh, where are you tonight?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Why and what's the reason for?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
How can I live for You?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
When he's standing in front of you?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
When did you leave heaven?
How many paths did they try and fail?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Before he can see the sky?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Am I still dreaming yet?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Have they missed you?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Across the swooping plain?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
For all these earthly things?
How's everything in heaven?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
By golly, what more can I say?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
What good am I?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Before they're forever banned?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Must everybody bow?
How could they let you go?
Can I come home with you?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
So I can know if I'm really real?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Oh, so why not you and me?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
How many compared to yesterday?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Am I ready?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
What else can a poor boy do?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
How could they ever mistake you?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
What can I do for You?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
But now something has changed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
And your trouble is you know it too good
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
I'll always thank the Lord
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Now, a very great man once said
Maybe someday you will understand
They took a clean-cut kid
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
I want you, baby, just to understand
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
And those whom doom and death had spared
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
But something has changed
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Many times I've often prayed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
While some, on principles baptized
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Silvio, silver and gold
As I stand upon the sand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
"Equality". I spoke the word
Somebody seen him hanging around
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Its iron claws attached
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Now, whenever I get up and
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
How many times can a man turn his head
I run right home and I went to bed
I've been walking around
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
There ain't nothing in this world
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I still can remember the way that you smiled
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Things would be different the next time we wed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Just what you had in mind
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
And things would be different the next time we wed
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Now you don't seem so proud
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
So I'll make my stand
And then you told me later as I apologized
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
He was a clean-cut kid
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
But she ain't gonna find the road
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
I will not go down under the ground
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
She let go of my hand
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
To see him obviously framed
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Nothing was delivered
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
For what you sold that's not been received
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
All the sweethearts you can hold
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And into the path you are hurled
It's something you did
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
We live in a political world
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
You used to be so amused
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
By no special friend
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Now you don't act so––so proud
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
I thought that it was well-understood
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
I live in another world
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Everything stays down where it's wounded
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You used––be so proud
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Little did I realize
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Breaking hearts up and down the line
You said you'd never compromise
Among the lovely people living free
Well, it's all new to me
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
I am homeless, come and take me
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Hunger pays a heavy price
Knows there's no success like failure
What's probably got you baffled more
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
It's getting dark, too dark to see
When the roses fade
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
I do declare
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
She been gone
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Looking at hands for the lines that were
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And I ain't complaining none
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
You into thinking you're the one
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Full of hope and desire
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
At dawn my lover comes to me
But I can get another one
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
The crashing waves roll over me
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
They say don't come back no more
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
From all the plans they do pursue
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Should I put them by your gate
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
I don't even notice she gone
"That I might be gone a long, old time
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
With all memory and fate
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
What good am I then to others and me
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Well, six white horses that you did promise
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
It'll be with me unto the grave
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
And plenty time for good romance
Taking care of somebody nice
She plunged him into well water where
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
I rode with him in a taxi once
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
"It's only you that he does crave
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I can survive and I can endure
When I'm all alone
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
That she's the same one
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
You smiling through the fence at me
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
He'll see by his grave
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
To show you something you seen before
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
There were times when I was so lonesome
All I feel is heat and flame
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
And suddenly there appeared before me
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
But I can't say I sympathize
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
You're not free to belong to me
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
So up she picked her babies three
We see this empty cage now corrode
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
You just pick anyone
You cut to the core
And never sat once at the head of the table
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
You know, it's not even safe no more
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
But I feel nothing for their game
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
So I look like a walking mountain range
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Lies that life is black-and-white
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
The man the authorities came to blame
Limited in sex they dare
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Just what you will say when you get home
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
How many ears must one man have
Up into some paradise
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Better stay away from those
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Con you into thinking that you're the one
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Why wait any longer for the one you love
From the Golden Gate Bridge
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
If dogs run free, why not we
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Mona tried to tell me
Though its shadow's metal badge
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
From the start by the rule
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
A bed that is never mine
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And you see why it's so unique to be
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
And I'm just the same as anyone else
You say you're looking for someone
Just pick anyone
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
I been wondering all about me
See the primitive wallflower freeze
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
As he rises to fame
The cause was there before we came
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Feel to moan, but unlike before
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
If dogs run free, why not me
So, I called up the operator of time
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Remember me to the one who lives there
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
When the rain is blowing in your face
What about that millionaire
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And the Negro's name
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
What you're gonna say when you get home
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Remember me to one who lives there
To give the special one you seek a chance
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Waiting to find out what price
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
She knows there's no success like failure
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
And that is that one must always flush out his house
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
So I remember every face
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
And I would send a message
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
How was I to know you'd be the one
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
It's all new to me
When Reilly's daughter got a message
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
If dogs run free, then what must be
While them that defend what they cannot see
On the rising curve
Says it's closing time
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Should I leave them by your gate
I'm ready for to fade
But the dark does die
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
You could almost think that you're seeing double
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Oh, trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
'Cause the battle outside raging
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
They're drinking up and walking
The order is a-rapidly fading
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the cards are no good that you're holding
There's nothing in here moving
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Well, I set my monkey on the log
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Deceived me into thinking
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
It's not a bad way to make a living
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
If I was with her too long
She rode by night and came by morning
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
You left me standing in the doorway crying
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The order is rapidly fading
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Where the time and the tempo drag
But then a whistle will be blowing
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Beyond here lies nothing
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
The battle outside raging
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
For your weary toes to be touching
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Early in the morning, early in the morning
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I have fallen far beneath
Then she told us how times were tough
And how I know I'll make it through
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
You go north and you go south
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
I wish she'd unlock
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Her voice once and talk
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You turn around to take a final peek
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Shoot in the back
The man in me will do nearly any task
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Well, there ain't no going back
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Then why don't she tell
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
A girl by the whirlpool
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
As the last fire-truck from hell
Ring bar, hard to tell
They ask me how I feel
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
But among the dead that were left on the hill
How does it feel
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Soul to soul our shadows roll
How many seas must the white dove sail
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
He's taught in his school
All and all can only fall
He's sure got a lot of gall
I chased me a woman up the hill
Ring bell, hard to tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
And if my love is real
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
A-how does it feel
Oh, how does it feel
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Well, if I die on top of the hill
How many seas must a white dove sail
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Muttering small talk at the wall
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You better not chew gum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
But I can hear another drum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Two eyes took the aim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
"For you cannot relive them
And remain as I am
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
There was little to say, there was no conversation
And she aches just like a woman
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Uncle Rat went running downtown
And she wakes just like a woman
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Their religion of the little ten women
But the post office has been stolen
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
But the second mother was with the seventh son
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Well, you fake just like a woman
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Somebody new to beat on
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
All their daughters put me down
From heights that they could not gain
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Yes, and someone must explain
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Darkness at the break of noon
Guns and clubs followed him down
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Must meet the dawn
To remember the times when I was your only man
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Have died in battle or in vain
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
To my knowledge there's just one man
But all their daughters put me down
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
The ones that jump on the wagon
As they rode him in custody down to the station
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
"Not me," said the gambling man
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
That long, black train is pulling down
Yet I swear I see my reflection
But it's hard to think on
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
How can the life of such a man
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Well, I'm hanging on
As you sit on the box you keep him in
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Will not be understood as they're spoken
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
And the corner sign
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
That long, black train is pulling on down
How many roads must a man walk down
In ceremonies of the horsemen
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
For the loser now will be later to win
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
I figure maybe we're even
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
He got that fortress on the mountain
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
I'll be waiting at the station
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
In the pigpen
Out of the shower comes a football man
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And all their daughters put me down
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And you ache a-just like a woman
Why did you trade heaven
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
But me, I expected it to happen
But I swear I see my reflection
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
You don't need a weatherman
She got such a sweet disposition
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
All lay down their bandanas and complain
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
She said that all the railroad men
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Advertising signs that con
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
I don't even care if I ever see her again
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
My love, she's like some raven
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
You need something to make it known
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Nothing we can call our own
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
You take just like a woman
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
A-she takes just like a woman
Trying to get a lead on
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Suicide remarks are torn
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
For the loser now might be later to win
And there's no exit in any direction
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
The next morning she had awoken
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
She takes just like a woman
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
All I really wanna do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
There is a place you go
Every place I wanna go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
There's nothing you can say or do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
All I'd like you to do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Silvio, I gotta go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
How many times must a man look up
Aladdin and his lamp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
I walked down there and ended up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Man in the coon-skin cap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
What good am I while you softly weep
In one I was running and in another
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
The face of God will appear
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
So, don't fear if you hear
Still I say her love-words over
Still I've always kind of missed her
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
But morning is clear
I close my eyes and I wonder
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
I say, "Why you say that for
The wind howls like a hammer
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
At any moment you could go under
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Never no more do I wonder
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
When you whispered in my ear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And I don't even think about her
When only you are near
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I could feel a whole lot better
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Who came here from Cuba's door
For I am married to a house carpenter
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
All you boys better run for cover
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
My ship is in the harbor
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I don't have to go far
You heard me saying a prayer for
Alone you stand with nobody near
The lover who has just walked out your door
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
For all eternity I think I will remember
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Now, you must provide some answers
I'm gonna let you pass
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Good and bad, I define these terms
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Don't follow leaders
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
To memorizing politics
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
With a big bouquet of the roses
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
They whisper in the wings
People on the platforms
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Statues made of matchsticks
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
That it's you and no one else that owns
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Don't wear sandals
Wants eleven dollar bills
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
And the poor white remains
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
With a fantastic collection of stamps
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
To sharpen the senses
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
And your father, to your sister he explains
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Well, the ragman draws circles
Seven days
The cowboy angel rides
Girl by the whirlpool's
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
On the back of the fish truck that loads
You should be made to wear earphones
And then complains
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
We living in times when men commit crimes
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
I'd gladly confess
And the princess and the prince discuss
And I try to harmonize with songs
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And so Patty calls the cops
You know that he has no intentions
And without further notice asks you how it feels
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Her window's wide open, African trees
To the cutting of fences
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Six-time users
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
"Not me," said the man whose fists
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
But, though the masters make the rules
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
People carry roses
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
You been hurt so many times
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
What good am I if I say foolish things
Six-time losers
Glide across the lonely years
He's not selling any alibis
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
At times I think there are no words
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You can fall down on your knees
And inside it with the people made of molasses
True love can make a blade of grass
You never turned around to see the frowns
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
I try to tell it like it is
How many deaths will it take till he knows
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
When your mother sends back all your invitations
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
As friends and other strangers
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
But still remains
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Romantic facts of musketeers
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Thinking of a series of dreams
And tells me of her dreams
And, though the masters make the rules
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
We can hold up a toast if we meet
They tell me revenge is sweet
Talking that the heat put
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
How many years can a mountain exist
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
One more night I will wait for the light
I'm on the pavement
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
She seems too far out
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
The slow one now will later be fast
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
To hold each other tight
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
But, then again, there's only one I've met
How many years can some people exist
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
It don't take too long to find out
One more night the moon is shining bright
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And I, in my armor, turning about
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Johnny's in the basement
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Everyone still talks about
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
You are there in the flickering light
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Wait for the morning light
There's some people that
Without any doubt
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
He really wasn't where it's at
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
So he never thinks straight
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
And, since my feet are now fast
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Ain't it hard when you discover that
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
That might be all that you got
Keep me set apart
To keep it in your mind and not forget
They tell me to be discreet
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I got into the driver's seat
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Like a corkscrew to my heart
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Keep it in your mind and not forget
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
By the way, that's a cute hat
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
I think that it's best
You don't forget
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Plants in the bed, but
You used to laugh–make fun about
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
In the stillness of the midnight
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And the first one now will later be last
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
In the precious winds they rot
Everything is always right
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
I soon get some rest
But, if the arrow is straight
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
You're hearing my heart beat
With your pockets well protected at last
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
You used to laugh about
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
I'm moving after midnight
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
You're gonna get hit
The slowest now will later be fast
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
He built a fire on Main Street
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
I can be just like you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I just might have to come see you
It's just crazy being here with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To be alone with you
And I tell this truth to you
I'll remember you
To protect you and defend you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
It only goes to show
I'd sure like to know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
But sooner or later one of us must know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Down every street there's a window
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Don't it always a-go to show
Don't it always go to show
The only one I know
Well, I'd sure like to know
Sooner or later one of us must know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Ring them bells for the chosen few
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
He been living there three years now
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
The Spanish-American War had its day
Is worth more than I could pay
To those condemned to act accordingly
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Maggie says that many say
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
For them that think death's honesty
So they took him to the infirmary
Spouted out that liberty
Though I'd never say
And the ladies treat me kindly
And that which you've given me today
She starts to speak, but he walks away
For them that must obey authority
And I'm leaving every day to run away
That I was just a puppet in a play
She smiles, walks the other way
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And the only tune my guitar could play
No, you'll not now or no other day
But I wish there was something you would do or say
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Went to the doctor the very next day
So I run down most hurriedly
And it's up to you to say
The same thing I would want today
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
She knocked upon it anyway
And for His love they took His life away
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
How many times must the cannon balls fly
I send you all my money
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
So, I'm walking down your highway
If I don't take the chance to try
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
But I can't deny
For them that think death––death's honesty
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Well, I saw it advertised one day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
She puts it to me plain as day
My mind weaves a symphony
From phony jealousy
My ears hear a symphony
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
A cock is crowing far away
We banged the drum slowly
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
I did not do it harmfully
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But you can never steal away
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
That I done it the way
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Or if you just want some company
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Don't you tell Henry
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Hang out the whole next day –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Hava–na–
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Oh, my–
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Havanagee–luh–
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Indians camp along her border –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
You will not hear a laugh –
How badly they were shocked –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
It can't be this way everywhere –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
That can win what's a-never been won –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
With notions his canoe was laden –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
With no other choice except but for to go –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Haven't seen her since that night –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
I long to hold you in the night –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Private reasons – great or small –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Turn, turn, turn again –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Havana–gee–
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Leave all the children home –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
I'm sure it was not three –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
To know where you are –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I hope that you can hear––
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Ha–va–
You'd come back and you'd stay –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I got no idea what I want –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
I a-hope you can hear––
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
First degree and second degree –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Disconnect these cables––
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
