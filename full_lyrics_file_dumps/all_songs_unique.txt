Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!

Get me outta here, my dear man!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Woo!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Good God!
Looking for my lo and behold!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!

Lo and behold! Lo and behold!

Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Dignity never been photographed!

Goodnight!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Hope I don't find out too much!
How they ever flood my soul!
Oh, yeah!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!

Dance!
She takes just like a woman - yes!

It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
I got the freight train blues!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!

This place don't make sense to me no more!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
My God, they killed Him!
You must think I'm crazy!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Oh, no!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
She's insane!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I've got a million friends!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
I've got the freight train blues!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!

You're a liar!

Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
They got away!
So long, New York!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Hootenanny television!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
It was the mailman!
Play that guitar now!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Alright!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
I'll bring back my lady."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
And have it on Highway 61."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Get on your horse and ride away."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Have it on Highway 61."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"That way down Highway 61."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
We want folksingers here."
So write to her tenderly."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Come flowing down so free?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Tangled up in blue."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
They look as dark as night."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
Country'll grow."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Where you and I will unite."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I would want again tomorrow."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
And hung on a willow tree."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I'll see her soon, I know."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
And punched my cigarette."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget, now, you are white."
You can't blame us at all."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
I didn't see you around."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
For that reason I will have to stay."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
You must know about my debutante."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
You can't blame me at all."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
We'll both go off together."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Will mourn for your return."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
We'll both go home together."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Would kill a little bird like me."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "Don't tell me, let me guess your name,"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"Is it easy to forget?"
And keep him good company."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
God said, "On Highway 61."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
But I know what you want."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
They look as white as snow."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
I can't find my knees."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
You and I'll never know."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
It's all for the love of thee."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
And it's all for the love of thee."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
And pretend that you never have met."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
I love far better than thee."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
That you must always first forgive them."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Someone to close his hear,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Every moon is so sanctified,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
We'll fly the night away,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
It's alright,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Look out, kid,
I'm never, never far from home,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Well, I can't understand,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
You wanna drown love,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
She leave by the other and roam,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
My love winks, she does not bother,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
You need something to open your eyes,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
No, nothing was delivered,
Wintertime in New York town,
In his anger and his shame,
But, deep inside my heart,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
For the wise men and the fools,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Look who's back in town,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
China doll, alcohol,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
I threw it all away,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Up and down the block,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
God knows there's a river,
So, never leave me lonely,
The night passed away so quickly,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
The Communists was a-coming around,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Said I'm pressing on,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
God knows you ain't pretty,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
My dear, sweet friend,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
It's a price I have to pay,
That five walls cannot hide him,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
With his fist in a clinch,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Don't let me change my heart,
This world is ruled by violence,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Though they could not produce the gun,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Get born, keep warm,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
I went down where the vultures feed,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Keep a clean nose,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
And it's like I ain't here,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Don't know what to do without it,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
My existence led by confusion boats,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
All that and more and then some,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
I leaned my back up against an oak,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
My woman's never sitting at home,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Who's never weak but always strong,
You were striped, you were plain,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
That her father was going to hang,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
In another I witnessed a crime,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Got me a secret membership card,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Too serious to fool,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Someone to close his heart,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
To your tambourine in time,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
In the end,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I won't have my nature way,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Drag you down or drain you down,
And she aches just like a woman,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
I just say no thanks,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
I'll be on my way,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
I'd already gone the distance,
That fellow who never blushes,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
If not for you,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Badge out, laid off,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,

Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,

Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
To hang and to lynch,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,

To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
God knows there's a chance,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,

Won't let go and I can't let go,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Socialism, hypnotism,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Adios, mi corazon,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,

On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
And they--they look at me and frown,
We've killed each one,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,

Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,

To gather flowers constantly,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
I had a job in the Great North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,

Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
My arms and legs were broken,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
And you fake just like a woman,
They lowered him down as a king,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,

Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
In the little church a-this side of tow,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,

They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
It still ain't me, babe,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,

May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
True love of mine,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Corrina, Corrina,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
No direction home,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,

He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
And to come every time you call,
You've got to serve somebody,
It's not aimed at anyone,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",

Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
God sees it all unfold,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
In the little church a-this side of town,
For his age he is wise,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Broken switches, broken gates,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Don't matter what you did,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
That fired the gun,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I been riding the midnight train,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Gonna serve somebody,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,

I believe in you even though we be apart,

And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Tell me that you love me only,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Don't let her hear,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
You could look at it and weep,
Don't you tell Henry,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
And here I sit so patiently,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
With a killer's pride, security,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
And when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
The haunted, frightened trees,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
I swung on to my old guitar,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Ain't no going back,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
I had so much left to do,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Make you spin or do you in,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
It's rising up above my head,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
My love, she speaks softly,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
But you're doing it again,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
You came down on me like white thunder,
When I seen him lose control,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
To keep up his hate,
Of ancient history,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Serve somebody,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Watch the plain-clothes,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
To know how much I really care,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
I've been in and out of happiness,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Advertising signs, they con,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Since you've been gone,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Made of silver or of golden,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
If'n you don't know by now,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
They say every distance is not near,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Go down to the river, babe,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Precious father, loving mother,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
I got a bird that whistles,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Don't ever try to change me,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
There she come, now, down my way,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Get back, write Braille,
Read books, repeat quotations,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Want you so bad,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Mercury, gravity,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
To protect his white skin,
But all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Don't let me drift too far,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
When the night comes falling,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
They keep it all hid,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Try to be a success,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Their folks, they said their lives together sure was a-gonna be rough,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Never needed to call you my whore,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
If you throw it all away,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
I've been around this whole country,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Speaking to some French girl,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
I can see the turning of the key,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
I ain't looking to block you up,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
Too noble to neglect,
Never did feel this way before,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
To be--direction home,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
I can finish this alone, honey,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
But something has changed,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
And I'm in the shade,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Mixing up the medicine,
I went into the city, into the town,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
People carry roses,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
And on the highway of regret,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
But evidently she don't,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
The carpet too is moving under you,
You and me, we had completeness,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Bringing me all of your charms,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
With no direction home,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Tell me,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Thinking about the government,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Stripping away at it all,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Or select you or dissect you,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
One by one they followed the sun,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
By rivers of blindness,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Into my own parade,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I got no place left to turn,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
I thank the Lord,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
See you fly or watch you die,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Carry the New York Times,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Seven days,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
God knows there's a purpose,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
I can't understand,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
First to come in was the flying moth,
But he never did like it all that much and one day it just a-went to hell,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
In the ruins of your balcony,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Newspapermen eating candy,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
The night would see me wide awake,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Want you,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Just like a rolling stone,
But, to remain as friends,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
And also by his feet,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
This situation can only get rougher,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
People going down to the ground,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
And come every time you call,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Like a complete unknown,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Maybe when we both get sober,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Mama, wipe the blood off of my face,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Living in the land of Nod,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
God knows it's true,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
By the night and been to some place new,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
And point away from the past,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I don't care if you feel like me,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Thank You, Lord,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
More people kept a-piling on,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Oh, see what you can do,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
So glad,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
I found my world, found my world in you,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Pistol-shots ring out on a barroom night,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
It was you who came right through,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Everything's a-hers or his,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
My senses have been stripped,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Hang around the ink-well,
How many a year has passed and gone,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
And furnish me with tape,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Some speak of the future,
And you make love just like a woman,
All I really wanna do,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
You had enough of hatred,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
All you can do is do what you must,
I'm going out of my mind,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I like the way that you move your hips,
For the politician's gain,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Looking 'bout the government,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Here come the story of the "Hurricane",
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Well, come all without, come all within,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Giving back all of what you owe,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
I don't wanna fake you out,
The man in the trench-coat,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
You need something to open up a new door,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Paradise, sacrifice,
To be alone with you,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
At the close of the day,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Don't let her see,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Poor boy never say die,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Now you don't talk so loud,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
For all intended purposes,
Carved next to his name,
Hold me, baby, be near,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
In the image of someone you used to know,
Saved,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
In the foggy web of destiny,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Just like I did before,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Now, love is gentle, love is kind,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Stone you and say good luck,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Private reasons, great or small,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
That four ears cannot hear him,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Don't let her see where you're going,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
But, if I can save you any time,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Better jump down a manhole,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Every head is so dignified,
Heart of mine,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
You can raise up your right hand,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
I just can't do what I've done before,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Till he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
God knows you've got to weep,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Is looking for a new fool,
So now I'm going back on again, I got to get to them somehow,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
To be on your own,
Bring the wife and family,
Searching high, searching low,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
I can hear Him calling for my soul,
By users, cheaters,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Try hard, get barred,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
How does it feel,
If anything is gonna sell,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
But, if you want me to,
I went into the city, went into the town,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Strangers all give me the news,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Got my mind made up,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Face full of black soot,
Far away and over the wall,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
To shine in through,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
All the silver, all the gold,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Tears on the letter that I write,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Going,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
And I--I walk out on my own,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Need a woman all the time,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
All day long I hear him shouting loud,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
There's always someone who understands,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
In the great unknown,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Madams light the candles,
And ride a horse along the trail,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
They run a brick and tile company,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
And think they're fooling you,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Rubin Carter was a-falsely tried,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Without a love of my own,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
I try my best to be just like I am,
I just keep pressing on,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
We wanna put his ass in stir,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Sara, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Mama, I can hear that thunder roar,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
The air is getting hotter,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
I got my mind made up,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
So he drifted down to New Orleans, lucky not to be destroyed,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
So now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
They--they show me to the door,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
She takes just like a woman,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Can't find what I need,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
That must be what it's all about,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Like a rolling stone,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Someone to open each and every door,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Out to the windy beach,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
By losers, cheaters,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
To strict party-platform ties,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
And gathering storms may arise,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Each time we meet, love,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
That can do what's never been done,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Loyalty, unity,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Sara, Sara, wherever we travel, we're never apart,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Beating for the dead that rise,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Waiting for the trains,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
The Second World War came to an end,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
The day you quit me, baby,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I would not feel so all alone,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Well, I may just swear,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Laying low,
Oh, singing just for you,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Well, I'm so glad,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
God knows everything,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
I can make it through,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
People talk of situations,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
While paupers change possessions,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
You married young just like your ma,
Spent my money on you, honey,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Like you never did before,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
I'm going down the river,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
But I would not feel so all alone,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Well, I'm pressing on,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
We live in a political world,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
She'll surely turn to white,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
In the darkness of my night,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Don't follow leaders,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
It hurts me, too,
You to me were true,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
She said she would never forget,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Look away, you rolling river,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
I just don't see why I should even care,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
A question in your nerves is lit,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
And the night blows rainy,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Go away from my window,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
First degree and second degree,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Better jump down the manhole,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Joey, Joey,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
I went into the red, went into the black,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
And your streets are getting empty,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
The beat is pumping,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
God knows there's a heaven,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Memory, ecstasy,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
It could even be like a myth,
She would have married me,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Broken idols, broken heads,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
You're beautiful to me,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
True love, they've been without it,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
You follow, find yourself at war,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Father of day, father of night,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
My limbs are shaking,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Don't let yourself fall,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
I'd give you the sky high above,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
On this new morning, new morning,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Icicles hanging down,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
When he drifted down to LA where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Each one playing a horn,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Going, going, gone,
"Not I," said the referee,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I'll go see them come down my way,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
We never much thought we could get very old,
And ye shall be a-changed,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
In the instant that I preach,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Six months on the chain gang,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
And may you stay forever young,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
God knows it's a struggle,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
But I know that he don't talk,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
And when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Made before the foundation of the world,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
It's like I ain't here,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
The only son of God Almighty,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
And the whole world is on your case,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Stay away from the train line,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Going home,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
To find out if she's talked,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
They don't believe in mercy,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
They walk among the stately trees,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
For something that he never done,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
I had no one for to go my bail,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
And, if anybody asks me,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Well, get sick, get well,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
So I got those worries blues,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Yet every distance is not near,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
And, if I see the day,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
And I don't want to drag you down,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Gay as a jewel when first it’s new,
Who will promise never to part,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
When she lays upon the grass,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Grandpa died last week,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Who could they get to carry you,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I'm leaving today,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Stone you just like they said they would,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Like as not, it's better so,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Where he got him a job on a fishing boat docked outside Delacroix,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
The midnight rain follows the train,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Honey, just for you to climb,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
And the point is slick,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
When there is no more,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
To stay closer than any friend,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Over the hills and far away,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
"Come along and take a trip,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
They pass by so silently,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Saying over her shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
That lover, who just walked out your door,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Friends with you,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Well, you take just like a woman,
A handle hid out in the dark,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
One by one until there were none,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Precious angel under the sun,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Cares not to come up any higher,
You will be alright, girl,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
I once held her in my arms,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
The angels play on their horns all day,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
God knows how to make it flow,
Loaded deep as deep can be,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
God don't call it wrong,
Make promises by the hour,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
My hands didn't touch him none,
I could have left this town by noon,
She aches just like a woman,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
I run right home and I went to bed,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
And to come each time you call,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
He won't do nothing to you,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
My hands can't feel to grip,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
God knows it's a crime,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
And it ain't me, babe,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Or have done something wrong,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
I need someone to talk to and a new hiding place,
But you try with your whole soul,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
To have--be on your own,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
But he can't be blamed,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
I bless the day I found you,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
May be an actor in a plot,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
You broke a heart that loved you,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Just as long as you stay with me,
I love you, pretty baby,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Father of cold and father of heat,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I rambled out of New York town,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Ye shall be a-changed,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
You want watered-down love,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
People talk over situations,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
You got something I want plenty of,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
My woman needs it every day,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
If I didn't have to guess,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
God knows it's outta sight,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
He had a job in Santa Fe working in an old hotel,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
That's the story of the "Hurricane",
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
If you must cling to someone,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Don't put yourself over the line,
He is centuries old,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Poor boy dressed in black,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Tell her not to worry,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
How he died nobody can say,
And the sooner you come up with them,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
In love and with kindness,
Ye shall be changed,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
To be one your own,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Like a dog on a chain,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Aim well, my little one,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Using every angle under the sun,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
To a solid rock,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Father of black, father of white,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Where I will always be renewed,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Dust on my face and my cape,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
I got the worried blues,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Equality, liberty,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Of this I can't say very much,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Make promises by the hours,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Don't let her know,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
In the lonely night,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Without a dream in my heart,
With what your fate is going to be,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Love don't have any place,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
You can run down to the desert,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
So unknown,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
They say every man need protection,
I have no one to meet,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
The train leaves at half past ten,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Don't tie no bows,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
I'd be sad and blue,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
God don't call it treason,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
You have explained every mystery,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
And, although that we're single and free,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
It was from her ship sailing,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
A hand set the spark,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
We got you for that motel job. We were talking to your friend, Bello,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Stand up straight and tall,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Father of air and father of trees,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Go melt back in the night,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
And she'll be coming forth,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Alfred Bello laid this rap on the cops,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Watered-down love,
You made it there somehow,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
I don't care if you analyze me,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
New morning,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
They say everything can be replaced,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
God knows when,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Watch the river flow,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
That the laws are with him,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Someone who will die for you and more,
Just then the order came to charge,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
I couldn't see where we were going,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
With the juice running down my leg,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Name of Martin Luther King,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Like some mystery,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Never weak but always strong,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Come all without, come all within,
I just don't know what to do,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
He's the property of Jesus,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
In one the surface was frozen,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Give me the wings and I could fly,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
And I answer them most mysteriously,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
I never can go because, you know,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
I landed up on the downtown side,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
That you'd have liked me to,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Not the end, not the end,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
For she ain't the same,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
That they do not respect in any degree,
You stole her love from me one day,
Watching the river flow,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Thieving in the alley,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
The kingdoms of experience,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Says he's got a bad bill,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
A complete unknown,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
I can't be good, baby,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
It don't matter what you did,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Front door shut, back door too,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Where life and death are memorized,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
While riding on a train going west,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Going, going,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
I don't want to meet your kin,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Judge and jury took their stand,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Under the microscope,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
A worried man with a worried mind,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
Just don't know what to do,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
You got to serve somebody,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Looking for a new fool,
You better chew gum,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
They say that every man must fall,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
May you stay forever young,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
You'll change your last name, too,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Well, the job that you used to have,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Yes, I'm so glad,
As his youth now unfolds,
And I got the worried blues,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Two by two they step in the dark,
You have laid down Your life for me,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
They must bust in early May,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
A man with a badge skips by,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Strike another match, go start anew,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Forever young, forever young,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
I think we better talk this over,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost,
I got a wife and five little children,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Something about you that I can't shake,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Far away from it all,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
She got great big hind legs,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
You even make love just like a woman,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
The only thing I knew how to do was keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
I'm pledging my time to you,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
The winter would hold no spring,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Resent him to the bone,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Drifting too far from shore,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
But it would not be new,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
I wish tonight were here,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
You'll be doing society a favor,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
In the hills of mystery,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Give you my money, honey,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
You gotta look some other place,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Pressing on,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
For her to arrive,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
You're beautiful beyond words,
I've been saved - well, alright,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
You have given me eyes to see,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
And not going through any great extreme,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Father of night, father of day,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Baby, please stop crying,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
The sky too is folding under you,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Some are mathematicians, some are truck drivers' wives,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Beyond here lies nothing,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
It always has hit me from below,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
But I'm saved,
Far away in the stormy night,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Nothing too very scientific,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I try my best to be like I am,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Eh, in somebody's room,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
God knows it's fragile,
So now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
You always responded when I needed your help,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Went back home to the yard,
As the present now will later be past,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
People are crazy, times are strange,
God knows it's terrifying,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
And, if I can save you any time,
You have given everything to me,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Four by four, no illusion for,
But I've been hanging on,
Oh, in somebody's room,
And make promises by the hours,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
As the daylight hours do increase,
But now morning is clear,
I can change, I swear,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Fare thee well but for a while,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
And I'm back in the rain,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Heart of mine, be still,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Let's hear the story of the "Hurricane",
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
If you'd see me this way,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
But it ain't him to blame,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Trust yourself,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
He's young and on fire,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill,
We'll go someplace unknown,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
In a pine box for all eternity,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
And, though the line is cut,
Don't steal, don't lift,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Hmm, see what you can do,
And I'm just like that bird,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
In the turning of twilight,
One by one they follow the sun,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
It's really something,
And I'm so glad,
Hmm, I can make it through,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
May be living in another country under another name,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
See her in that very tight skirt,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Oh, watered-down love,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
And I got those worried blues,
I been good while I been waiting,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
I get my sweet reward,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
"Not me," said his manager,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I'd only have to stay,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
You don't have to feed me,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
The joint is jumping,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Without your sweet love,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
If ever I prove false to you,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
To be so useless and all,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
The country doctor rambles,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Without ideals or violence,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Loneliness, tenderness,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
How he died nobody could say,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Three angels up above the street,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
But she takes just like a woman,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Day you quit me, baby,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
I should have left this town this morning,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Just to know that you are near,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
But, if I will save you the time,
Take the motherless children off the street,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
The one we can see and can feel,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Eh, singing just for you,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Winter would have no spring,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
But I'm pressing on,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Over your senses you have no control,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
All them prophets good and gone,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
When I was in Missouri,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Roll, Willie, roll,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
He's not selling any alibis,
I shall be released,
So I drifted down to New Orleans where I lucky was to be employed,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You were snow, you were rain,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
She'll be coming forth,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
A true love of mine,
Automobile coming into style,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
And give him back the time he's done,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
I want you,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
When all will be well,
It always means so much,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Eh, see what you can do,
The night blows rainy,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Light yourself a candle,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
A million faces at my feet,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I got those worried blues,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
You have given all there is to give,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Vanished from my hand,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Somewhere down the road some day,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Enter Patty Valentine from the outer hall,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Nothing was delivered,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
She's opened up a happy home,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Love that's pure no accident,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Don't let yourself stumble,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Simplify you, classify you,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Three by three they're turning the key,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Had no one to go my bail,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Trouble,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
You got something better,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
And you take just like a woman,
To be without a home,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
The day would surely have to break,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
The wind howls like a hammer,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Circled by the circus sands,
I want you so bad,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Crumble into one another,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Is used, it is plain,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
They say every man needs protection,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
A dream about you, baby,
From their fates try to resign,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
I'm so glad,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
A thousand miles from home,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Yes, and I'll go last,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Baby, let me follow you down,
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
That foreign sound in your ear,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Then they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Relationships of ownership,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
And you know I could never be your own,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Keep me where you are,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Oh, Angelina,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
If today was not a crooked highway,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
I had a dream about you, baby,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Ever since I been a child,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Who among them would try to impress you,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
You have given me life to live,
If you'd see me this a-way,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
And there's two white horses following me,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Every brain is civilized,
And forget my pride,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Thinking it was a trusty tree,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Staying far behind without you,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
But the time ain't tall,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
I been good,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
They say every man must need protection,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Well, well, well,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
They say every man must fall,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
They tell me every man must fall,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Hanging 'round the theaters,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
The cloak-and-dagger dangles,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
To be out on your own,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
Is it really any wonder,
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Don't mind the driving rain,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
But it ain't me, babe,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
She once was a true love of mine,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
God knows that, when you see it,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
She said she would always stay,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
The light I never knowed,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
But you were gambling for support,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
You find God in the church of your choice,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
I got two white horses following me,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Dream about you, baby,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
And when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
We take great delight in our own company,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Don't try No Doz,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Where the neon madmen climb,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Read books and repeat quotations,
On the stone that remains,
The country music station plays soft,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
He had a job in the old North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I want my arms around you,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Human gods aim for their mark,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
The sky too is folding over you,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Ten thousand men on the move,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Searching everywhere I know,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Don't wear sandals,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
When it's over, I'd just as soon go on my way"--
It can't be this way everywhere -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
They crammed me back into the county jail -
With notions his canoe was laden -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
That's where you belong --
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
I long to hold you in the night -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
Hang out the whole next day -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
To know where you are -
Remember me to one who lives there -
Private reasons - great or small -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
Havanagee-luh-
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
We just wanted to see some sweat -
Haven't seen her since that night -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
Turn, turn, turn again -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
That can win what's a-never been won -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
With no other choice except but for to go -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I hope that you can hear--
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
As suicide remarks are torn -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
Ha-va-
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
Hava-na-
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
Disconnect these cables--
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
I got no idea what I want -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
Indians camp along her border -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
Oh, my-
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
I'm sure it was not three -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
Havana-gee-
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
You will not hear a laugh -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
Democracy don't rule the world --
Ten thousand miles or more -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
How badly they were shocked -
Leave all the children home -
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
Whispering your secret emotion -
First degree and second degree -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
Thank--
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
I a-hope you can hear--
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Lost time is not found again.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
But she had some way of finding them out.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
I been worrying about you, baby.
And shot it fulla holes.
From my toes up to my ears.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Just remember that death is not the end.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Most of the time.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
To see that you're madly in love.
That's the day you die.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Soft as music, light as spring.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Got ice water in my veins.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
With my suitcase in my hand.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Until my dying-day.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
Hoping you'll come through too.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Her fond face pale with woe.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
With all these promises you left for me.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Friends with you.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
But you can't see in and I--it's hard looking out.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Honey, come and see about me.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
You can show me a new place to start.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
What looks like the easy way out.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Just what this song is all about.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
She pretends like we never have met.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Don't have to look no further - you're the soul of many things.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Without a love of my own.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
And pretend that we never have touched.
In the palace of the Pope.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
But simply because it's true.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
So I beg you: let it be me.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
Or define you or confine you.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Mary wore three links of chain.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
But not as deep as the love I’m in.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
While the law looks the other way.
He never did know what it was all about.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here-it's, uh-have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd-I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".
Tell her her baby's on the line.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Is gonna be against the law.
Someone's watching over you.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
There were six thousand people there.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
And they gotta cut something.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
The next day could be your last.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
We were the wrong side.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Oh, convey herself away.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
You are on the bottom.
She murdered mortal he.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
She acts like we never met.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Ever since I seen her smile.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Tell me.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
It was all over by a quarter past.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Where you fought for my soul and made up against the odds.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Trust yourself.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.

Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Never been so easy or so slow.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.

Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
You won't get it for money.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.

Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
He ain't-a got no name.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
A-lord, protect my child.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Went into the laundry to wash my clothes down.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Kisses she gave him three.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Or stay all night with thee.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
I don't know any more than this.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
From the little Minnesota town.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
He gone north for a while.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
Rode slowly back again.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.

When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
She's in some foreign land.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.

And then unto eternity.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
I'm ready when you are, Senor.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Girls like birds fly away.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
I can walk anytime around the block.
If'n you don't know by now.
This kind of love, I-I'm lovesick.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
That's the way I remember her best.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Every link was Jesus's name.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Last radio is playing.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Try to avoid the scandals.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
But I can't get close to her at all.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.

Everybody's having them dreams.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
All because his face was brown.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
You're bound to fall" - you thought they were all kidding you.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Must be and that is all.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Without this love that we call ours.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Bid farewell forever.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
And I need you, ah.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
He and Arthur Dexter Bradley went a-prowling around.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
It don't matter, anyhow.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
He's got his mother's eyes.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
It only brings me sorrow.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Precious memories flood my soul.
And I've never been too impressed.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Everybody that was hanging out.
You to me were the best.
And say you'll always let it be me.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Oh, yes, they did.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
But you break just like a little girl.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Please quit your low-down ways.
But it was more than I could do.
You're my honey.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Far down the street we stray.
I'm younger than that now.
That can win what's never been won.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
At the sorority sisters' home.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Somebody better investigate soon.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Now they say it's the land of money.
I once held her in my arms.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Now you don't talk so loud.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
All my connections too.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Tangled up in blue.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Four by four they turn it some more.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
You'd better get that in your head.
Lay your hand upon my head.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
Walking around with no one else.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
And left me here facing the wall.
Trouble...
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Where I was born and partly raised.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
I can't hear you anymore.
Got to have done some evil deed.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
It don't matter anyhow.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
And the sails are spread.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Unless they're from another world.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
Hope you're ready.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Sara, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Heart of mine.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
I did not do it knowingly.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Just you and me.
"And light on my right knee.
Valentines can't buy her.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
And I's left alone with three children.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Drink up your blood like wine.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.

His voice was low with pain.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
And that failure's no success at all.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
It's just the old American way.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley - that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this-this is a song-this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
See him at play makes me smile.
'Steada acting like we never met.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.

Going through all these things twice.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
The light I never knowed.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Because everybody must get stoned.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
And I want you to be that woman.
I see that stationmaster too.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Come on, darling.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Trying to create a next world war.

I took some comfort there.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.

Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
Remember me to one who lives there.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.

And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Wants to get it paid off.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
But I would never do you wrong.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.

With the golden loom.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.

And ye shall be changed.
I just go pump on it some.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
That's really and truly an American.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
There's no words that need to be said.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
And I need you, yeah.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
That last night I was with.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
If I ride back again.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I said that.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
His mama sure was proud of him.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
"Don't point your finger at me.
I can't use it anymore.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Where teardrops fall.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
I'm just average, common too.
That number eleven was closing.
This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
A man named Martin Luther King...
And all your raging glory.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
I know the kinds of things you like.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Blues wrapped around my head.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Saying wants company.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Throw my mattress out there too.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Duality, mortality.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
"And stay all night with me.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Like you never done before.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
And come away with me.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Chain you down or be your clown.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
A true love of mine.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
The place that I started from.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Sara, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Everything is gonna be fine.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Baby, baby...
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Rain would gather too.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
You can say I didn't give to you.
When he played and we didn't dance.
To be alone with you.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Reality has always had too many heads.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
So long, honey babe.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Come on, baby...
Mama, you are on my mind.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
And she'll only know he's dead.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Drifting too far from shore.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
See like me or be like me.
And she makes love just like a woman, and she breaks just like a little girl.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
As if a wedding vow.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
I'll remember you.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Till your error you clearly learn.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
Just crying out that he was framed.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
Oh, got my mind made up.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Hope I don't blow it.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
They seem determined to go all the way.
Memories of what used to be.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
I been in this thing too long.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
I'm not the one you need.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
The sooner you can go.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Mine alone.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
It always does when you're with me.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
My baby took my heart from me.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
But my heart just won't give in.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Thanks for coming. We'll be in the area for a few days. Maybe we'll see you tomorrow at 9.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
But the fighter still remains.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Alright, thank you very much.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.
Thanks.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Magic in a magical land.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
And both shall row, my love and I.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Go find out something only dead men know.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
At my window with a broken wing.
Baby, baby.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Living down Sonora way.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, mystical wife.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
Baby, two feet from the well.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
I don't believe you.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
But he sure left here in style.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
You got it, baby.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Step lightly on the ground.
You don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
To which a scoundrel clings.
There was nobody around.
Broken voices on broken phones.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
To the old folks' home and the college.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
And one day he came passing by.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
And each one I've never seen again.
Thank y'all.
The water is wide and I can’t cross over.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
At the end of the trail.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
She saw her father's body broken.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
Till she sees finally she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Going back where we come from.
And tapestry of rhyme.
She just acts like we never have met.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Greenwich Village.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
So, darling, you better come through.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
They don't make nothing here no more.
In the brightness of my day.
And crime don't have a face.
And your golden loom.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
I can't fight them anymore.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Leading me, going home.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Know not what the years may hold.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Suffering like a fool.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
But there's a slow - yeah, there's a slow - there's a slow train coming.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
So many people I never saw in my life.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Adios, mi corazon.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Look a-the other way.
Standing on your window, honey - yes, I've been here before.
I got a bird that sings.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
You're too hot, darling.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
I hope I'm ready.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
I didn't realize how young you were.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
I had something to protect.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Tried to create a next world war.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Mama, you been on my mind.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
But you're back where you belong.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Well, our captain, he is dead - died for a maid.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And I'll rock you too.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
To keep her from the howling winds.
And laid his life on the line.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
And discovered her invisible self.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
She once was a true love of mine.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
When my memory is not so short.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
And try to avoid the scandals.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
When I'm alone with you.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
In the pale moonlight.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
I had so little time to fail.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
For your times, they are a-changing.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
You want a watered-down love.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
While I'm in the hall.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Our chances really was a million to one.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Sara, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
And rivers that ran through every day.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
I can't see through it anymore.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I--but I just don't know how.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
You may not see me tomorrow.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
You break your promise all over the place.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
And I'll go last.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
But you're never sure why you're here.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
To reach of your rattling drums.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a-a diamond as big as your shoe.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the--lonely still.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
In the dark land of the sun.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
And keep away from pranks.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
And your highway's getting filled.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
All because of the color of his skin.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
He's always on trial for just being born.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Is when I'm alone with you.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
That I really did try to get close to you.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
But you were tangled up in blue.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Everything is gonna be alright.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Headed out for the western skies.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Behind a man's brain.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
That must be what it's all about.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Lord, protect my child.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I just can't beg you anymore.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
Rain would gather, too.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
They both rode off together.
They found him dead in the street one day.
But you're not even sure what it is.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
And neither have I wings to fly.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Chain you down or bring you down.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
I'd give anything to be with you.

For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
The night will soon be gone.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Blowing through another no-good town.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Have fallen from her curls.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
And disregards the rest.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Or put up against the wall.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
To hold me in your arms.
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.

Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.

People sleeping in broken beds.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.

I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".

You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
But these to tell what's true.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.

Going down from God's distant shore.
It was raining from the first and I was a-dying out there of thirst so I came in here.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
On this new morning with you.

The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.

He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.

May you stay forever young.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.

We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Even before you came in the door.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.

Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
We all know for sure that it's real.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Leave no stone unturned.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
Never will want for money.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Epitome, rigidity.
You'll do as much for me.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
By the jealousy of others around her.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
I shall be released.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Yes, tell me.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
I stood wondering which way to go.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
I followed the winding stream.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Please let me ride you home.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
For me to return to or chase.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
After losing every battle.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
But I was raised on the other.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Some place so high above the wall.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
And every window made of glass.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
That big, old boat started to sink.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
I know they're not what they seem.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
I'm going where I never been before.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
I long to reach for you in the night.
I've seen trouble all my days.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
I never saw the man again.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
When I run outta things to investigate.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Under the hedges.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
You left me standing out in the cold.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
You know, I loved her just the same.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's a-time for us to quit.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
The hour when the ship comes in.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
An innocent man in a living hell.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
To anything I might've tried.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Six by six...
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
Close your eyes, close the door.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
They're all gonna take on down by the bounded bank.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bow have fallen from her curls.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I don't know.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
I know not if I sink or swim.
But mine was a little different, you see.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Up and down the lonesome town.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Wasn't any difference to me.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
And another man named Bello, moving mysteriously.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
If you throw it all away.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
At not getting their money's worth.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Down along my restless palms.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Baby, let me follow you down.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away - we're gonna forget it.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
People bending broken rules.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
While evening slips away.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Yeah, here's one for ya.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Gone as the season she's taken.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
I hate bears.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
If not for you.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
To the sin of love's false security.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
I don't even know why we come.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
Everything is broken.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Good as I been to you.
Than people who are most content.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Some place so high above this wall.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
For the times, they are a-changing.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
You can't win with a losing hand.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Just like so many times before.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Ever since I seen you there.
Orders from the D.A.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Come on, baby.
When I paint my masterpiece.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
While my conscience explodes.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
I feel like I'm looking at a-heaven's door.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
'Cause I don't think about it.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
I hear them semis rolling too.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Thank you.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
And get something quick to eat.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
And guarded them as they fell.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Need that woman straight and true.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
When my working day's through.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Things will be alright by and by.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Bring that bottle over here.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
You got a heart of stone.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
And it never seemed strange.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
It'll never do, somehow.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
And there's no time to think.

But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.

It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Evidently she won't.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
So quickly into autumn.

Nobody stops to ask why.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.

The man you were loving could never get clean.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Serve somebody:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
But there's one promise, darling:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
His epitaph plain:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Till I come into New York town:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
In Paterson, that's the way things go:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Had to be held down by big police;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Everybody that was hanging out;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
I find complete love;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
About everybody that was hanging out;
So many things that we never will undo;
All lies and jest;
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, how could you refuse?
But who did I see but the one I love?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Does anyone even try?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
And how does it feel?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Am I still dreaming yet?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Ready, George?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
How many compared to yesterday?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Who killed Davey Moore?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
For all these earthly things?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Poor boy, where you been?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Before they're forever banned?
Are you the same person that was here before?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's chasing after me?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Am I ready?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
What can I give to You?
Across the swamp of time?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
What else can a poor boy do?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Too many people have died?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
To love and follow His direction?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
And one deserving of affection?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
The love that a stranger might receive?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
How's everything in heaven?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
So I can know if I'm really real?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Crime was murder one and guess who testified?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
That too many people have died?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Has anybody seen my love?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Can I come home with you?
How does it feel?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
I seen better times, but who has not?
How could they ever mistake you?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Just like a rolling stone?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Across the swooping plain?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Can you get back in?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Is it rolling, Bob?
How many more can they afford?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
How can I live for You?
What would life be?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
When did you leave heaven?
Have they missed you?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Why would I want to take your life?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Where did you hide your halo?
Don't the moon look good, honey, shining through the trees?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
What good am I?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Are you ready?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
How many more without any reward?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Must everybody bow?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
What's wrong with you this time?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
By golly, what more can I say?
Before he can see the sky?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Don't the brakeman look good, baby, flagging down the Double E?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Like a rolling stone?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
How could they let you go?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Gal, where you been so long?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Before you call him a man?
Where did you lose your wings?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Why and what's the reason for?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
What?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Of everything you see?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
How much poison did they inhale?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Baby, can't you tell?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
What can I do for You?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Who's gonna let it roll?
When he's standing in front of you?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Before he can hear people cry?
How come you don't send me no regards?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
But something has changed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And those whom doom and death had spared
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
But all that suffering was not to be compared
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
It's something you did
Things would be different the next time we wed
I had to say something to strike him very weird
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
I will not go down under the ground
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Standing on the water, casting your bread
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
I thought that it was well-understood
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
--Arthur Dexter Bradley and Bello and they both lied
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
As I stand upon the sand
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And into the path you are hurled
But love grows old and waxes cold
Now you don't seem so proud
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Nobody has to guess that a-baby can't be blessed
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
He was a clean-cut kid
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
I want you, baby, just to understand
I've been walking around
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
He wagged his tail and shook his head
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
But she ain't gonna find the road
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now you don't act so--so proud
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Silvio, silver and gold
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Just what you had in mind
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
They took a clean-cut kid
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
I run right home and I went to bed
Nothing was delivered
How many times can a man turn his head
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
So I'll make my stand
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Now, whenever I get up and
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
You used--be so proud
And your trouble is you know it too good
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
"Equality". I spoke the word
Either from the mountains of Madrid
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
You try so hard, but you don't understand
And then you told me later as I apologized
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
And that even the nobles get properly handled
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
By no special friend
Its iron claws attached
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
To see him obviously framed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
We live in a political world
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
But now something has changed
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
You used to be so amused
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
I live in another world
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
There ain't nothing in this world
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
All the sweethearts you can hold
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
For what you sold that's not been received
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Many times I've often prayed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
I'll always thank the Lord
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
She let go of my hand
Now, a very great man once said
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Maybe someday you will understand
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
The changes I was going through can't even be used
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
And things would be different the next time we wed
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
While some, on principles baptized
Somebody seen him hanging around
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
I rode with him in a taxi once
But the first it bent and then it broke
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
What good am I then to others and me
I can survive and I can endure
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Breaking hearts up and down the line
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
And I would send a message
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Looking at hands for the lines that were
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
And you see why it's so unique to be
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Should I leave them by your gate
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
On the rising curve
I been wondering all about me
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
They say don't come back no more
Maybe someday you will look back and see
I'm ready for to fade
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
It'll be with me unto the grave
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
So I remember every face
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Con you into thinking that you're the one
You into thinking you're the one
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
You know, it's not even safe no more
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
All I feel is heat and flame
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Should I put them by your gate
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
A girl who would murder her own, true love
And I ain't complaining none
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Little did I realize
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
And that is that one must always flush out his house
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Though its shadow's metal badge
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
If dogs run free, why not me
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Better stay away from those
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
So up she picked her babies three
You just pick anyone
It's getting dark, too dark to see
She plunged him into well water where
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
And suddenly there appeared before me
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
You're not free to belong to me
How was I to know you'd be the one
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
It's all new to me
A bed that is never mine
"Oh, father, you will surely die
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
How many ears must one man have
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
While them that defend what they cannot see
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
If dogs run free, why not we
Well, it's all new to me
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
But I can get another one
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
She knows there's no success like failure
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Where I could watch her waltz for free
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
At dawn my lover comes to me
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
She been gone
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
The cause was there before we came
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Full of hope and desire
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
When I'm all alone
And the Negro's name
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
The man the authorities came to blame
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
With all memory and fate
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Everybody's wearing a disguise
We see this empty cage now corrode
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Just pick anyone
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Mona tried to tell me
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
When the rain is blowing in your face
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
You cut to the core
And her silver-studded phantom cause
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
You could almost think that you're seeing double
But I feel nothing for their game
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
What you're gonna say when you get home
That she's the same one
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
But I can't say I sympathize
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
If dogs run free, then what must be
You said you'd never compromise
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
There were times when I was so lonesome
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
What about that millionaire
Says it's closing time
"It's only you that he does crave
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
And never sat once at the head of the table
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
The crashing waves roll over me
So, I called up the operator of time
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I am homeless, come and take me
Up into some paradise
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Remember me to one who lives there
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
From all the plans they do pursue
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Just what you will say when you get home
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
You say you're looking for someone
What's probably got you baffled more
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
To give the special one you seek a chance
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
You smiling through the fence at me
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
And plenty time for good romance
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
But the dark does die
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
I don't even notice she gone
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Leaving men wholly, totally free
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
I do declare
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Remember me to the one who lives there
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
From the start by the rule
He'll see by his grave
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Waiting to find out what price
Lies that life is black-and-white
Taking care of somebody nice
Knows there's no success like failure
Among the lovely people living free
As he rises to fame
Hunger pays a heavy price
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
So I look like a walking mountain range
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
From the Golden Gate Bridge
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
To show you something you seen before
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Feel to moan, but unlike before
When the roses fade
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Limited in sex they dare
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
The order is a-rapidly fading
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
For your weary toes to be a-touching
For your weary toes to be touching
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
They're drinking up and walking
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
There's nothing in here moving
If I was with her too long
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
I know that you know that I know that you show something
The battle outside raging
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Where the time and the tempo drag
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
The order is rapidly fading
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Deceived me into thinking
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And there's no telling who that it's naming
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
But then a whistle will be blowing
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
It's not a bad way to make a living
She rode by night and came by morning
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
'Cause the battle outside raging
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Beyond here lies nothing
Well, I set my monkey on the log
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And how I know I'll make it through
Then she told us how times were tough
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
You go north and you go south
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I have fallen far beneath
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
You turn around to take a final peek
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
But they caught him and they brought him back
I wish she'd unlock
Shoot in the back
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
The man in me will do nearly any task
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Well, there ain't no going back
Her voice once and talk
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
As the last fire-truck from hell
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
I chased me a woman up the hill
He's sure got a lot of gall
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
He's taught in his school
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Then why don't she tell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
To make all that should be killed to crawl
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
How does it feel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
How many seas must a white dove sail
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Muttering small talk at the wall
Oh, how does it feel
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
A-how does it feel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
But among the dead that were left on the hill
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
How many seas must the white dove sail
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And if my love is real
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
All and all can only fall
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Yeah, but if I die on top of the hill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
They ask me how I feel
A girl by the whirlpool
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Ring bar, hard to tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
You better not chew gum
But I can hear another drum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Two eyes took the aim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
And remain as I am
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
"For you cannot relive them
And she aches just like a woman
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
You take just like a woman
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
And all their daughters put me down
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
But I swear I see my reflection
She said that all the railroad men
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Trying to get a lead on
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Uncle Rat went running downtown
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, you fake just like a woman
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
My love, she's like some raven
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
I don't even care if I ever see her again
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
In ceremonies of the horsemen
To remember the times when I was your only man
But the post office has been stolen
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
But me, I expected it to happen
And the smell of their roses does not remain
He got that fortress on the mountain
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Will not be understood as they're spoken
The next morning she had awoken
Darkness at the break of noon
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
A-she takes just like a woman
All lay down their bandanas and complain
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Have died in battle or in vain
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
"Not me," said the gambling man
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
That long, black train is pulling on down
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
And she wakes just like a woman
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
For the loser now will be later to win
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
She got such a sweet disposition
As you sit on the box you keep him in
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Their religion of the little ten women
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
But all their daughters put me down
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Yes, and someone must explain
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
From heights that they could not gain
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
I'll be waiting at the station
Guns and clubs followed him down
Why did you trade heaven
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
That long, black train is pulling down
How can the life of such a man
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Must meet the dawn
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
But it's hard to think on
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Please don't let on that you knew me when
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
She takes just like a woman
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Somebody new to beat on
Advertising signs that con
And you ache a-just like a woman
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
You don't need a weatherman
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
And there's no exit in any direction
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
For the loser now might be later to win
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
And the corner sign
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Yet I swear I see my reflection
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Out of the shower comes a football man
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Nothing we can call our own
How many roads must a man walk down
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Well, I'm hanging on
To my knowledge there's just one man
You need something to make it known
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Suicide remarks are torn
I figure maybe we're even
All their daughters put me down
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
The ones that jump on the wagon
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
In the pigpen
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
All I really wanna do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
There's nothing you can say or do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Silvio, I gotta go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Every place I wanna go
Build me a boat that can carry two
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
All I'd like you to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
There is a place you go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Man in the coon-skin cap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
How many times must a man look up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Aladdin and his lamp
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
The man in the coon-skin cap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What good am I while you softly weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
I walked down there and ended up
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
My ship is in the harbor
The lover who has just walked out your door
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
When only you are near
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
I could feel a whole lot better
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
When you whispered in my ear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Still I've always kind of missed her
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Alone you stand with nobody near
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
All you boys better run for cover
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Who came here from Cuba's door
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The wind howls like a hammer
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
So, don't fear if you hear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
At any moment you could go under
You heard me saying a prayer for
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
Still I say her love-words over
I close my eyes and I wonder
For all eternity I think I will remember
And I don't even think about her
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
I don't have to go far
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Never no more do I wonder
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
For I am married to a house carpenter
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
In one I was running and in another
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
The water is wide and I can’t cross over
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
The face of God will appear
I say, "Why you say that for
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
But morning is clear
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
I was thinking of a series of dreams
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
People carry roses
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
You never turned around to see the frowns
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Romantic facts of musketeers
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Seven days
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And, though the masters make the rules
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Good and bad, I define these terms
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Girl by the whirlpool's
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
That it's you and no one else that owns
To sharpen the senses
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
But still remains
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
As friends and other strangers
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Thinking of a series of dreams
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
They whisper in the wings
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
The cowboy angel rides
And tells me of her dreams
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Six-time losers
You know that he has no intentions
What good am I if I say foolish things
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
But, though the masters make the rules
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
To memorizing politics
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Statues made of matchsticks
Wants eleven dollar bills
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
We living in times when men commit crimes
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Mama, you know, awaits the news
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
To the cutting of fences
With a big bouquet of the roses
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And the poor white remains
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Don't wear sandals
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
How many deaths will it take till he knows
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Six-time users
I'm gonna let you pass
And so Patty calls the cops
At times I think there are no words
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Well, the ragman draws circles
Glide across the lonely years
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
He's not selling any alibis
With a fantastic collection of stamps
You should be made to wear earphones
"Not me," said the man whose fists
I let it slip gladly to my friends
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And the princess and the prince discuss
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Her window's wide open, African trees
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Now, you must provide some answers
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
I try to tell it like it is
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
True love can make a blade of grass
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And I try to harmonize with songs
People on the platforms
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
You been hurt so many times
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Don't follow leaders
And then complains
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
I'd gladly confess
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
You can fall down on your knees
And your father, to your sister he explains
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Everything is always right
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
The slow one now will later be fast
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
In the stillness of the midnight
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
He really wasn't where it's at
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Keep it in your mind and not forget
I'm on the pavement
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Wait for the morning light
Oh, everybody's got to eat
You used to laugh-make fun about
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Without any doubt
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
The slowest now will later be fast
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
How many years can some people exist
You're gonna get hit
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
That might be all that you got
There's some people that
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Everyone still talks about
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
They tell me to be discreet
So he never thinks straight
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Someday, everything is gonna be different
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
And the first one now will later be last
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
By the way, that's a cute hat
But, if the arrow is straight
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
I'm moving after midnight
To hold each other tight
Keep me set apart
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
I got into the driver's seat
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Every new messenger bringing evil report
I was too young to know you were doing it right
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
I think that it's best
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
I soon get some rest
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He built a fire on Main Street
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
You don't forget
In the precious winds they rot
You used to laugh about
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Johnny's in the basement
One more night the moon is shining bright
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Plants in the bed, but
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Yet you know there is no answer fit
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
How many years can a mountain exist
They tell me revenge is sweet
Well, I finally started thinking straight
You're hearing my heart beat
Talking that the heat put
And I, in my armor, turning about
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
With your pockets well protected at last
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
You are there in the flickering light
It don't take too long to find out
And, since my feet are now fast
She seems too far out
One more night I will wait for the light
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
It's just crazy being here with you
To protect you and defend you
And I tell this truth to you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I just might have to come see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I can be just like you
I'll remember you
To be alone with you
I seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Sooner or later one of us must know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
He been living there three years now
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always go to show
It only goes to show
With only you in view
Well, I'd sure like to know
Don't it always a-go to show
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
He seen a lot of women but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
The only one I know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I'd sure like to know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Down every street there's a window
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
But sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
She smiles, walks the other way
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
And the only tune my guitar could play
But you can never steal away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
We banged the drum slowly
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
And it's up to you to say
That I was just a puppet in a play
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Well, I saw it advertised one day
That I done it the way
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Spouted out that liberty
But I can't deny
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Is worth more than I could pay
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
So they took him to the infirmary
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
She knocked upon it anyway
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Don't you tell Henry
I did not do it harmfully
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Went to the doctor the very next day
She puts it to me plain as day
She starts to speak, but he walks away
And the ladies treat me kindly
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
For them that think death--death's honesty
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
For them that think death's honesty
The same thing I would want today
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Or if you just want some company
If I don't take the chance to try
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
My ears hear a symphony
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
The Spanish-American War had its day
How many times must the cannon balls fly
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
And that which you've given me today
Though I'd never say
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
And I'm leaving every day to run away
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
A cock is crowing far away
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
I send you all my money
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
To those condemned to act accordingly
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
No, you'll not now or no other day
And for His love they took His life away
For them that must obey authority
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
So I run down most hurriedly
My mind weaves a symphony
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
So, I'm walking down your highway
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Maggie says that many say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
From phony jealousy
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
I laid on the dune and I looked at the sky
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
