She's insane!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
It was the mailman!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
I've got the freight train blues!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Hootenanny television!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Take me down to California, baby!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Oh, yeah!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
They was all over!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Oh!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
Pressing on - oh, yes, I am!
They got away!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
I wanna be yours!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Thank you!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Dance!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Yippee!
Yes, come out your window!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Woo!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Play fucking loud!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Goodnight!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
So long, New York!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Good God!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
You must think I'm crazy!
He punched me out!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
Them Reds did it!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Start over!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Alright!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
You're a liar!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
I'm in love with you!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
Yeah, man!
I've got a million friends!
How they ever flood my soul!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Betty Ross!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Dignity never been photographed!
Howdy, East Orange!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
Oh, no!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Woo-hoo!
I ain't different than anyone!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Looking for my lo and behold!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Alright, now!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
My God, they killed Him!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I got the freight train blues!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Hope I don't find out too much!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Well!
Play that guitar now!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Lordy, Lord!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
I would want again tomorrow."
And punched my cigarette."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
God said, "On Highway 61."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
I'll bring back my lady."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
And have it on Highway 61."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Tangled up in blue."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And pretend that you never have met."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Is it easy to forget?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I'll endow them onto thee."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
We want folksingers here."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
From across that lonesome ocean."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
I can't find my knees."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
It's all for the love of thee."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
And keep him good company."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
Come flowing down so free?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
"Have you seen dignity?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
That you must always first forgive them."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
I didn't see you around."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
They look as dark as night."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
I love far better than thee."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "Don't tell me, let me guess your name,"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
But I know what you want."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
You and I'll never know."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Would kill a little bird like me."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
They look as white as snow."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
"That way down Highway 61."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Country'll grow."
And hung on a willow tree."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
You can't blame us at all."
You can't blame me at all."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
You must know about my debutante."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Has kindly assisted me home."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
We'll both go off together."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
So write to her tenderly."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
I'll see her soon, I know."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"I've had too much of your company,"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Where you and I will unite."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Have it on Highway 61."
But we were tangled up in blue."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
We'll both go home together."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Will mourn for your return."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
And it's all for the love of thee."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Never did feel this way before,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Go away from my window,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
The only thing I knew how to do was keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
That must be what it's all about,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Oxford Town around the bend,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
When he drifted down to LA where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
You've got to serve somebody,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
To be one your own,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Memory, ecstasy,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
And I got those worried blues,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
To have--be on your own,
I'm pledging my time to you,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
If anything is gonna sell,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Madams light the candles,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
It was from her ship sailing,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
A question in your nerves is lit,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
You have given me life to live,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
My woman needs it every day,
Since you've been gone,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
To be without a home,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
For her to arrive,
I been good while I been waiting,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
That fellow who never blushes,
Crumble into one another,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
It's too bad he had to go,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Saying over her shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
And point away from the past,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
But, if you want me to,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
They lowered him down as a king,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
I like the cool way you look at me,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
I'm going down the river,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Seem like I been down this way before,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Get born, keep warm,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Mixing up the medicine,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Keep a clean nose,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
So now I'm going back on again, I got to get to them somehow,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
And you know I could never be your own,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
She got great big hind legs,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
In the ruins of your balcony,
As I travel down life's pathway,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Get jailed, jump bail,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
I'm never, never far from home,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
So now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Beating for the dead that rise,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I think we better talk this over,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
You were snow, you were rain,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Nothing too very scientific,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
I get my sweet reward,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
I had so much left to do,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Saved,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
And I don't want to drag you down,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
I'm so glad,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
She never does me wrong,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Over the hills and far away,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
She once was a true love of mine,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
God knows there's a heaven,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix,
My woman's never sitting at home,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
You need something to open your eyes,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Drifting too far from shore,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
You want watered-down love,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
The path you've endured has been rough,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
A true love of mine,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Eh, in somebody's room,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
You'll change your last name, too,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
It's like I ain't here,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
So glad,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Go melt back in the night,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Beyond here lies nothing,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
And, though the line is cut,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
The wind blowing the snow around,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
This situation can only get rougher,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Don't wear sandals,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
The country doctor rambles,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Till he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Puffing on a big cigar,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
But, to remain as friends,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
To know how much I really care,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
She's the worst you could ever have,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
The man there said he loved my sound,
It's alright,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
There's always someone who understands,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Want you so bad,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Hold me, baby, be near,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Someone who will die for you and more,
Well, I been gambling so long,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Advertising signs, they con,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
My love winks, she does not bother,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Laying low,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Trust yourself,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
So, never leave me lonely,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
But, if I will save you the time,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
They run a brick and tile company,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Got my mind made up,
How he died nobody could say,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Just like I did before,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Ooh, watered-down love,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
You had enough of hatred,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Stone you just like they said they would,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Like a complete unknown,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
In the instant that I preach,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
But it ain't him to blame,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
I won't have my nature way,
Tell me,
And the table's full and overflowed,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Up and down the block,
Just then the order came to charge,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
It's a price I have to pay,
He won't do nothing to you,
First to come in was the flying moth,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Going,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
They say every man need protection,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Ten thousand men on the move,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Each one playing a horn,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
And to come every time you call,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Whether you are right or wrong,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
People talk over situations,
To hang and to lynch,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
They took a clean-cut kid,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
All that and more and then some,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
As the daylight hours do increase,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
But you try with your whole soul,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Father of black, father of white,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
I once held her in my arms,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
But now morning is clear,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
He been around the world and back again,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Don't wanna be a bum,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Love don't have any place,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Dust on my face and my cape,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
But it would not be new,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
Stone you and say good luck,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
You have given everything to me,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
At the close of the day,
Looking 'bout the government,
I march in the parade of liberty,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Oh, singing just for you,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Far away and over the wall,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Yesterday's just a memory,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
The night would see me wide awake,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Just remember that death is not the end,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
She would have married me,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
You can raise up your right hand,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
And the point is slick,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
I've been saved - well, alright,
Don't let her hear,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Waiting for the trains,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
I thank the Lord,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
I rambled out of New York town,
She'll surely turn to white,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
The day would surely have to break,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
A dream about you, baby,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
To strict party-platform ties,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Every nerve is analyzed,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
And your streets are getting empty,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Better jump down a manhole,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Gay as a jewel when first it’s new,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
All day long I hear him shouting loud,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
You made it there somehow,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Poor boy never say die,
I got no place left to turn,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
I'm going out of my mind,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
I could have left this town by noon,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
You married young just like your ma,
In the end,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
I want you so bad,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Broken hands on broken plows,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Hang around the ink-well,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
For something that he never done,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Watered-down love,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
By rivers of blindness,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
But, if I can save you any time,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
It's rising up above my head,
Go down to the river, babe,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Yet every distance is not near,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
It still ain't me, babe,
And I'm just like that bird,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Well, well, well,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
I can't understand,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
And played the fife lowly,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Over your senses you have no control,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
And I'm back in the rain,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Can't find what I need,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
So unknown,
One by one they followed the sun,
Come all without, come all within,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
In the great unknown,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
A hand set the spark,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Without a love of my own,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
You got something I want plenty of,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Resent him to the bone,
Love that's pure no accident,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
On the stone that remains,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Well, I'm pressing on,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
New morning,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
The train leaves at half past ten,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
To be out on your own,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Everything's a-hers or his,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
I don't care if you analyze me,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
The Second World War came to an end,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
The sky too is folding under you,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Day you quit me, baby,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Their folks, they said their lives together sure was a-gonna be rough,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Staying far behind without you,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Make promises by the hour,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
And come every time you call,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Well, the job that you used to have,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
If you must cling to someone,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
I just don't know what to do,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Thieving in the alley,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Well, come all without, come all within,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
To be--direction home,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
You're beautiful to me,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
You even make love just like a woman,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
But he never did like it all that much and one day it just a-went to hell,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
They pass by so silently,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
That you'd have liked me to,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
God knows there's a river,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Oh, watered-down love,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
To gather flowers constantly,
This world is ruled by violence,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
The man in the trench-coat,
The one we can see and can feel,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
But evidently she don't,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Don't know what to do without it,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
For all intended purposes,
Make you spin or do you in,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
People talk of situations,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
"Not I," said the referee,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Loaded deep as deep can be,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
They say everything can be replaced,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
They--they show me to the door,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Private reasons, great or small,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I had a dream about you, baby,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
It don't matter what you did,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
I got my mind made up,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Out to the windy beach,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Better jump down the manhole,
How many a year has passed and gone,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Baby, please stop crying,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Using every angle under the sun,
Loneliness, tenderness,
You stole her love from me one day,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
She's crying like an evil stone,
I like the way that you move your hips,
China doll, alcohol,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
Well, I may just swear,
You to me were true,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
And pretend that we never have touched,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
When I seen him lose control,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
You gotta look some other place,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
The midnight rain follows the train,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Someone to close his hear,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
It always means so much,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Don't let her see,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
If ever I prove false to you,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Just as long as you stay with me,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Silvio, I gotta go,
And also by his feet,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
They don't believe in mercy,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
You follow, find yourself at war,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Don't you tell Henry,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Searching high, searching low,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
You could look at it and weep,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
You don't have to feed me,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
My existence led by confusion boats,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Precious memories, how they linger,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Light yourself a candle,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
God don't call it wrong,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
But I'm saved,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Father of cold and father of heat,
And think they're fooling you,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
The beat is pumping,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
If not for you,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I don't want to meet your kin,
They tell me every man must fall,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
When I was in Missouri,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
I can make it through,
God knows it's fragile,
You have laid down Your life for me,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
God knows that, when you see it,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Father of night, father of day,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Of this I can't say very much,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
You got to serve somebody,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
I threw it all away,
Icicles hanging down,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
I'm leaving today,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
From their fates try to resign,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I need a shot of love,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Like a dog on a chain,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
But the bottles are done,
He's not selling any alibis,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Need a woman all the time,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Got me a secret membership card,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
To your tambourine in time,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
How does it feel,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Want you,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Loyalty, unity,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Yesterday is just a memory,
That her father was going to hang,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
On this new morning, new morning,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
With a killer's pride, security,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
As the present now will later be past,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
All the silver, all the gold,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Don't let me drift too far,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I just can't do what I've done before,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
When all will be well,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Every head is so dignified,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
You were striped, you were plain,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Front door shut, back door too,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Hmm, see what you can do,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
The day you quit me, baby,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
There's a ship and it sails on the sea,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Spent my money on you, honey,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Wintertime in New York town,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
And you take just like a woman,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Don't try No Doz,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
And it's like I ain't here,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
All I really wanna do,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
For she ain't the same,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Going, going,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
With the juice running down my leg,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Precious father, loving mother,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
And, although that we're single and free,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
I leaned my back up against an oak,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
I ain't looking to block you up,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Is it really any wonder,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
And I'm in the shade,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Well, I'm so glad,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Mercury, gravity,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
They say every distance is not near,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Stand up straight and tall,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Is looking for a new fool,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I can't be good, baby,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Simplify you, classify you,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
She's opened up a happy home,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
The light I never knowed,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
And there's two white horses following me,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Like a rolling stone,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
He's young and on fire,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
And here I sit so patiently,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
I have no one to meet,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Father of minutes, father of days,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
When God and man will be reconciled,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
A worried man with a worried mind,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
God knows it's a crime,
And she aches just like a woman,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Nothing was delivered,
We live in a political world,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Father of day, father of night,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
And the night blows rainy,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I can see the turning of the key,
Where the neon madmen climb,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
In the image of someone you used to know,
You have given me eyes to see,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
She said she would always stay,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Someone to open each and every door,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Said I'm pressing on,
As his youth now unfolds,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Gonna serve somebody,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
He had a job in Santa Fe working in an old hotel,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Father who build the mountain so high,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Carry the New York Times,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I just don't see why I should even care,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Forever young, forever young,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Is used, it is plain,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
But he can't be blamed,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
I found my world, found my world in you,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
And make promises by the hours,
We take great delight in our own company,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Silhouetted by the sea,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Had a dream about you, baby,
A million faces at my feet,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
But I know that he don't talk,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
If I didn't have to guess,
I got those worried blues,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
But I've been hanging on,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
By losers, cheaters,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Poor boy dressed in black,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Not the end, not the end,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Keep me where you are,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
That long, black train is pulling down,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
It always has hit me from below,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
And comes to a permanent stop,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
And joined the John Birch Society,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Relationships of ownership,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
For his age he is wise,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
A man with a badge skips by,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Made of silver or of golden,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Don't let her know,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Analyze you, categorize you,
She said she would never forget,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
They keep it all hid,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Who will promise never to part,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
And gathering storms may arise,
Don't let her know that you love her,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
To find out if she's talked,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Joey, Joey,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Living in the land of Nod,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
And ye shall be a-changed,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
I landed up on the downtown side,
The sky too is folding over you,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Courage is a thing of the past,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Don't let yourself stumble,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
The kingdoms of experience,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And, if anybody asks me,
You have given all there is to give,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
People going down to the ground,
Now, love is gentle, love is kind,
To be alone with you,
Try hard, get barred,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
In the lonely night,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
They say every man must need protection,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Some things are too hot to touch,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Make promises by the hours,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
If she ain't feeling well,
He's the property of Jesus,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
By the night and been to some place new,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Father of air and father of trees,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
It could even be like a myth,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
She leave by the other and roam,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Thinking it was a trusty tree,
Heart of mine,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Three angels up above the street,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Watch the river flow,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
The winter would hold no spring,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Where life and death are memorized,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Watch the plain-clothes,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
But it ain't me, babe,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
The angels play on their horns all day,
No direction home,
And give him back the time he's done,
Vanished from my hand,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
That can do what's a-never been done,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Adios, mi corazon,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Ye shall be a-changed,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
All the tired horses in the sun,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Some are mathematicians, some are truck drivers' wives,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
When she lays upon the grass,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I never can go because, you know,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
He is centuries old,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
But you're doing it again,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Holding his club like he was a king,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Get dressed, get blessed,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
So many roads, so much at stake,
You'll be doing society a favor,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Then they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Something about you that I can't shake,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Don't ever try to change me,
I'd be sad and blue,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Without your sweet love,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Equality, liberty,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
She'll be coming forth,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Look away, you rolling river,
Pick you up every time you fall,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
While riding on a train going west,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
The night blows cold and rainy,
You broke a heart that loved you,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Give what I got until I got no more,
I love you, pretty baby,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Far away in the stormy night,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
I wish tonight were here,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
The air is getting hotter,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
When the night comes falling,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Already the fiesta has begun,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
I'd already gone the distance,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
More people kept a-piling on,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
And I'm so glad,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
I try my best to be like I am,
Without ideals or violence,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Speaking to some French girl,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Winter would have no spring,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
But you were gambling for support,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
But all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
For the politician's gain,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
You need something to open up a new door,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
By users, cheaters,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
And I--I walk out on my own,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Thank You, Lord,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
You have explained every mystery,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
It hurts me, too,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
God knows it's terrifying,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
I can change, I swear,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Look who's back in town,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Of ancient history,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
True love of mine,
To protect his white skin,
Face full of black soot,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
With his candle lit into the sun,
And to come each time you call,
If you'd see me this way,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
And when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
The only son of God Almighty,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
God knows there's a purpose,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Stay away from the train line,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
If you'd see me this a-way,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
God knows you ain't pretty,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Like as not, it's better so,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Ain't no going back,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
May be an actor in a plot,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
The night blows rainy,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
They say that every man must fall,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
I run right home and I went to bed,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
With what your fate is going to be,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Till both of us fell by the way,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
God knows how to make it flow,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
God don't call it treason,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
They must bust in early May,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
I just keep pressing on,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Stripping away at it all,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
You wanna drown love,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Thinking about the government,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
While paupers change possessions,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
That the laws are with him,
And, if I can save you any time,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
Grandpa died last week,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Circled by the circus sands,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
He had a job in the old North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Tell her not to worry,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
So he drifted down to New Orleans, lucky not to be destroyed,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Ever since I been a child,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
So I got those worries blues,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
God knows it's outta sight,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
You came down on me like white thunder,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Serve somebody,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
To shine in through,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
True love, they've been without it,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Don't let yourself fall,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Well, get sick, get well,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Too noble to neglect,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
But something has changed,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Six months on the chain gang,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
When there is no more,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Don't matter what you did,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
I swung on to my old guitar,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
I want my arms around you,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Oh, see what you can do,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Where I will always be renewed,
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
It was a girl I learned it from,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Oh, Angelina,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Like some mystery,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
If you throw it all away,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Don't steal, don't lift,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
And, if I see the day,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Like you never did before,
And every cause that ever I fought,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Eh, see what you can do,
Why she did go,
My limbs are shaking,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Or select you or dissect you,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Seven days,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
If your time to you is worth saving,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Yes, and I'll go last,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
You better chew gum,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
And it ain't me, babe,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
In the little church a-this side of tow,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
See you fly or watch you die,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
I went down to scrub and rub,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
With his fist in a clinch,
Giving back all of what you owe,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
And you make love just like a woman,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I got the worried blues,
I went into the city, into the town,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I'd only have to stay,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Without a dream in my heart,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I can't cross the line, you know,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
And I got the worried blues,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Someone to close his heart,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Human gods aim for their mark,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Each time we meet, love,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
And forget my pride,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
That fired the gun,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Pressing on,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Father of loneliness and pain,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Bringing me all of your charms,
And may you stay forever young,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
And when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Never weak but always strong,
And on the highway of regret,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Wasn't making any great connection,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Look out, kid,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I don't care if you feel like me,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
A thousand miles from home,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
That can do what's never been done,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Eh, singing just for you,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Aim well, my little one,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
In love and with kindness,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
A man named Martin Luther King,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Get back, write Braille,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Who's never weak but always strong,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
"Not me," said his manager,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Early one morning the sun was shining, she was lying in bed,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Had no one to go my bail,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
If today was not a crooked highway,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
They walk among the stately trees,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Give you my money, honey,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Trouble,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Going, going, gone,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
In the darkness of my night,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
In one the surface was frozen,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
My dear, sweet friend,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Just like a rolling stone,
In his anger and his shame,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
God knows when,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
God sees it all unfold,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Bring the wife and family,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
All them prophets good and gone,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
I had a job in the Great North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
They say every man must fall,
For the wise men and the fools,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
First degree and second degree,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
No, nothing was delivered,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
To be so useless and all,
We've killed each one,
And when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
There she come, now, down my way,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
The carpet too is moving under you,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
People carry roses,
Cares not to come up any higher,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
All you can do is do what you must,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
One by one they follow the sun,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
It's really something,
To be on your own,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
We'll fly the night away,
You always responded when I needed your help,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Dream about you, baby,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Judge and jury took their stand,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Under the microscope,
Don't tie no bows,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
You got something better,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
The human mind can only stand so much,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
With no direction home,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
So I drifted down to New Orleans where I lucky was to be employed,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
God knows it's a struggle,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
I bless the day I found you,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
That four ears cannot hear him,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
To keep up his hate,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
And the whole world is on your case,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
You say my kisses are not like his,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
And she'll be coming forth,
It was you who came right through,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
And not going through any great extreme,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Heart of mine, be still,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But ye shall be a-changed,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
God knows everything,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Try to be a success,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
One by one until there were none,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
But I would not feel so all alone,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Badge out, laid off,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Far past the frozen leaves,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
The country music station plays soft,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Don't let me change my heart,
Who could they get to carry you,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Don't follow leaders,
One more night the stars are in sight,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Watching the river flow,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
In the hills of mystery,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
I shall be released,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
I would not feel so all alone,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
You and me, we had completeness,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
Where he got him a job on a fishing boat docked outside Delacroix,
Says he's got a bad bill,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Strangers all give me the news,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
God knows there's a chance,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Roll, Willie, roll,
I know I can't win,
I got a wife and five little children,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
But the time ain't tall,
Precious angel under the sun,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
The wind howls like a hammer,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
I want you,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Some speak of the future,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
But, deep inside my heart,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
You can run down to the desert,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
I should have left this town this morning,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Friends with you,
That lover, who just walked out your door,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
A complete unknown,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
They say every man needs protection,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
In the turning of twilight,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
You're beautiful beyond words,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Carved next to his name,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
My arms and legs were broken,
I've been around this whole country,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
And furnish me with tape,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
God knows you've got to weep,
I been good,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Give me the wings and I could fly,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
"Come along and take a trip,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
I've been all around the world, boys,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Just don't know what to do,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
To a solid rock,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I been riding the midnight train,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Looking for a new fool,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
But I will be back, I will survive,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Every brain is civilized,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
God knows it's true,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Ye shall be changed,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
So now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Just to know that you are near,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
To stay closer than any friend,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Into my own parade,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Too serious to fool,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
My love, she speaks softly,
May you stay forever young,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
How he died nobody can say,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
May be living in another country under another name,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
I'll be on my way,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Went back home to the yard,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
The joint is jumping,
My senses have been stripped,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Yes, I'm so glad,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
But I'm pressing on,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Far away from it all,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
As human gods aim for their mark,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Well, I can't understand,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Honey, just for you to climb,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
If'n you don't know by now,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Searching everywhere I know,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Going home,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
This place ain't doing me any good,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
I just say no thanks,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
It's not aimed at anyone,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Stone you when you are young and able,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
I got two white horses following me,
Corrina, Corrina,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Automobile coming into style,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
The night passed away so quickly,
I'll go see them come down my way,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Or have done something wrong,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
The cloak-and-dagger dangles,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
You will be alright, girl,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Two by two they step in the dark,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Tell me that you love me only,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
I got a bird that whistles,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
Turn, turn, turn again -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
With no other choice except but for to go -
Remember me to one who lives there -
That can win what's a-never been won -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
Havana-gee-
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
With notions his canoe was laden -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
That's where you belong --
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
Ten thousand miles or more -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
I got no idea what I want -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
Disconnect these cables--
Whispering your secret emotion -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
Haven't seen her since that night -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
I'm sure it was not three -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
Hang out the whole next day -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
Oh, my-
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
To know where you are -
Democracy don't rule the world --
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
Hava-na-
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Leave all the children home -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
As suicide remarks are torn -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
How badly they were shocked -
First degree and second degree -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
You will not hear a laugh -
Indians camp along her border -
I a-hope you can hear--
You say my kisses aren't like his -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
I hope that you can hear--
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Ha-va-
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
I long to hold you in the night -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Private reasons - great or small -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
It can't be this way everywhere -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
Havanagee-luh-
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
Thank--
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
And no time to think.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
I froze right to the bone.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
To make me think I'm wrong.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
I did not do it knowingly.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Have fallen from her curls.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
In this concrete world full of souls.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
"Don't trill no news on me.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
And the mailbox is locked.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
You're my baby.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Come on, honey.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
I didn't feel so cold then.
'Steada acting like we never met.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
But it was more than I could do.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Waiting on my burying ground.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
And then unto eternity.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
It ain't quite the end.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Thank y'all.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
For as long as love will last.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Going, going, gone.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
Crying out that he was framed.
I's looking around just to see myself.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
If you won't come out your window.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
You left me standing out in the cold.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
Bring that bottle over here.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
The whole night through.
People sleeping in broken beds.
The light I never knowed.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Orders from the D.A.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Kisses she gave him three.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
May you stay forever young.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
And time is beginning to crawl.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
From the little Minnesota town.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
But I ain't neither one.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".
That I left in the French Quarter.
I'm falling in love with you.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
If not for you.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
That brave and devoted band.
To live it you had to explode.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
The sooner you can leave.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
That keep us so tightly bound.
Everybody must get stoned.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
That last night I was with.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I can't hear you anymore.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
And your highway's getting filled.
Looking for a new friend.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
Don't have to look no further - you're the soul of many things.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
The hour when the ship comes in.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Everything is gonna be fine.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
A-lord, protect my child.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
I'll only let you down.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
I long to reach for you in the night.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Friends with you.
Is tearing up your mind.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
To see that you're madly in love.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
Go lightly on the ground.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
My face you'll never see no more.
But that's what I am paid to do.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
So I beg you: let it be me.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Rain would gather, too.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Is just equality in school.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
With all these promises you left for me.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
You have no idea what you do to me.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.

I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Lord, protect my child.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
The night will soon be gone.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
His enemies say he's on their land.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Please let me ride you home.
Hmm, tell me.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
But not as deep as the love I’m in.
An innocent man in a living hell.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
You to me were the best.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
See like me or be like me.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
You're on the bottom.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
Oh, her darling love she found.
That's really and truly an American.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
And it never seemed strange.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
With the glory that is to be.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Yes, tell me.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
I took some comfort there.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
In the summertime when you were with me.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Patriotism, materialism.
It'll never do, somehow.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
You're my honey.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Sound like it's on a final run.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Without this love that we call ours.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
But the mountains of the past.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
Until I threw it all away.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
Down to New Orleans.
That must be what it's all about.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Honey, I want you.
And I's left alone with three children.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
I've seen trouble all my days.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Oh, yes, they did.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
The next day could be your last.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
By the jealousy of others around her.
I threw it all away.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Suffering like a fool.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
But with the country to where you're going.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
You'll do as much for me.
I shall be released.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
And keep away from pranks.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I-I love her just the same.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Never been so easy or so slow.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
I need a shot of love.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
You're too hot, darling.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Mary wore three links of chain.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Blues wrapped around my head.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
I can't fire them anymore.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Somebody better investigate soon.
I'm not the one you need.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
But you're not even sure what it is.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Come on, darling.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Than people who are most content.
You want a watered-down love.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
What looks like the easy way out.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
At the end of the trail.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
It would go up against every rule.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Watch the parking meters.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Or stay all night with thee.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Come on, baby...
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
You're bound to fall" - you thought they were all kidding you.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Wants to get it paid off.
Till your error you clearly learn.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Under the midnight moon.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
Blood on your saddle.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Well, I'm just thumping.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
But my heart just won't give in.
On the caboose of the train.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Or define you or confine you.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
And shot it fulla holes.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
I find it so difficult to leave.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
I don't know.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
I hope you're ready.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
It sure is right on a night like this.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Living down Sonora way.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
That number eleven was closing.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
I've made shoes for everyone - even you - while I still go barefoot.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
At my window with a broken wing.
68, but says she's 24.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Trust yourself.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
I once held her in my arms.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
I will only let you down.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
New morning.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Everybody's having them dreams.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
I had something to protect.
I remember her whispering yet.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Join the army if you fail.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
To which a scoundrel clings.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Just what this song is all about.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
When you made everybody pay.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
You're drifting too far from shore.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Valentines can't buy her.
And she'll only know he's dead.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
At the sorority sisters' home.
I know they're not what they seem.
Four by four they turn it some more.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
I just can't see through it anymore.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And come away with me.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
That old ship was a-going down.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
All my connections too.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Got to have done some evil deed.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Hoping you'll come through too.
It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
But I never yet found Fennario.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Tell me.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
If you just let me follow you down.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
She's in some foreign land.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
You break your promise all over the place.
You're a big girl now.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
"And light on my right knee.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
What you'll say when you get home.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Lay dead beside him there.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
Chain you down or bring you down.
If you just let me come home with you.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Feel further away than ever before.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Up and down the lonesome town.
I want you.
Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
But simply because it's true.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
I followed the winding stream.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Some place so high above this wall.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
I had so little time to fail.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Throw my ticket out the window.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Even the softest touch.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Oh, Angelina.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
And there's no time to think.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
I hate bears.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
And each one I've never seen again.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Look a-the other way.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
She just acts like we never have met.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
You'd better get that in your head.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
I don't even know why we come.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
And gives it to me for a song.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
I don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
High society, notoriety.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley - that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this-this is a song-this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Good car to drive, after a war.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Lay your hand upon my head.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Leave no stone unturned.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
See that my grave is kept clean.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
You are on the bottom.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
I been worrying about you, baby.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Unless they're from another world.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
But I know that I can't move.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
I been in this thing too long.
I'd like to know.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
His voice was low with pain.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
Leading me, going home.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
68, but says he's 24.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
When my memory is not so short.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Fighting every inch of the way.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
To anything I might've tried.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
Greenwich Village.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
I don't know any more than this.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Under the hedges.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Epitome, rigidity.
And he was a friend of mine.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Your voice was all that I heard.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
I got trouble in my mind.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
But all I see are dark eyes.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did - lost a little weight.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
He's only a pawn in their game.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Most of the time.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
With your golden loom.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Your son is coming back from the war.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
The words that her lover had said.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Hmm.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
And I'll rock you too.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
The last radio is playing.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Know not what the years may hold.

It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.

The place that I started from.
And watch the parking meters.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.

And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.

And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.

He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.
And both shall row, my love and I.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Went into the laundry to wash my clothes down.
And there's a slow--there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
Duality, mortality.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.

But she had some way of finding them out.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.

Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
It was all over by a quarter past.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
I want everybody to be free.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.

Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.

I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.

Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
She saw her father's body broken.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Ever since we've been apart.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
I'm younger than that now.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.

Saying wants company.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
I know not if I sink or swim.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Someone's watching over you.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Going through all these things twice.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
It don't matter, anyhow.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Baby, baby.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl - and me - oh, God! - I'm a one.

Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.

To marry John Thomas, a miner.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.

Without a love of my own.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
And it is time for me to slide.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Just remember that death is not the end.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.

Precious memories flood my soul.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.

I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
I just go pump on it some.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.

On this new morning with you.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.

It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.

It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Got ice water in my veins.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Thanks.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.

A man named Martin Luther King...
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.

I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
But there's a slow - yeah, there's a slow - there's a slow train coming.

All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.

When I run outta things to investigate.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
You can't win with a losing hand.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Down along my restless palms.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
The whole world is my throne.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.

I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Sweet lady.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
See him at play makes me smile.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Neighborhood bully.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.

Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Soft as music, light as spring.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
It runs both cold and deep.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
For your times, they are a-changing.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Rain would gather too.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
A true love of mine.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Evidently she won't.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
So quickly into autumn.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
And discovered her invisible self.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.

Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Until my dying-day.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.

And crime don't have a face.
About an old man that never done wrong.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.

The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.

Well, our captain, he is dead - died for a maid.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
There's no words that need to be said.
I always thought that he was well.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Everything is broken.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
I'd give anything to be with you.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
That's the day you die.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
While the law looks the other way.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
And say you'll always let it be me.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
He bought your city on a one-way track.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Tell me that it isn't true.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
And get something quick to eat.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
We all know for sure that it's real.
You'll never see me frown.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Mama, you are on my mind.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Of every man who put me here.
I couldn't find any.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
For she once was a true love of mine.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
While evening slips away.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
They're all gonna take on down by the bounded bank.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
But the fighter still remains.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
It was you who understood.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
They want me for a gambling fight.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Dollar a day's worth.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
I know the kinds of things you like.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're-what you are but what you're not.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
She can't find him anywhere.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Honey, come and see about me.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Oh, convey herself away.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Mine alone.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
As the present now will later be past.
Baby, please come home.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Girls like birds fly away.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
If it just don't make me hurts.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
As if a wedding vow.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
There was nobody around.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
God knows...
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Going back where we come from.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
"And stay all night with me.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
By that soft and shining sea.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Find out something only dead men know.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Broken voices on broken phones.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
And every window made of glass.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
I know something is changed.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
I never saw the man again.
Tangled up in blue.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
I gave you all of what I could provide.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
I got a bird that sings.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
I see that stationmaster too.
Memories of what used to be.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
And the sails are spread.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Far down the street we stray.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Foundationed deep somehow.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Magic in a magical land.
While I'm in the hall.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
It's that million dollar bash.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
Baby, two feet from the well.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
You may not see me tomorrow.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
I can't use it anymore.
There were six thousand people there.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
I can't see through it anymore.
I'm just average, common too.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Life don't mean a thing.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Tried to create a next world war.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
And try to avoid the scandals.
And tapestry of rhyme.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
With my suitcase in my hand.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
I don't believe you.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
And all your raging glory.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
And you only got ten.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Must be and that is all.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
And guarded them as they fell.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
He's got his mother's eyes.
If you throw it all away.
All the faces we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
But you were tangled up in blue.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Now they say it's the land of money.
I needed somebody to talk to.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Like you never done before.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Baby, baby...
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
At not getting their money's worth.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
You can say I didn't give to you.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Everything is gonna be alright.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
From my toes up to my ears.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
They got him on conspiracy - they were never sure who with.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
I see better days and I do better things.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
I said that.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.
Nobility, humility.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
Turned on my record player.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
And I'll go last.
All because of the color of his skin.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
I hear them semis rolling too.
But you're back where you belong.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Every link was Jesus's name.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
It always does when you're with me.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Slowly into autumn.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
You can show me a new place to start.
When my working day's through.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
It was a normal day.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Everybody that was hanging out.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Just you and me.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Got my mind made up.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
My mind is breaking.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
To be alone with you.
Walking around with no one else.
Or inspect you or reject you.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
While my conscience explodes.
Her fond face pale with woe.
To anything I mighta tried.
That can win what's never been won.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
I'm going where I never been before.
They both rode off together.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
His mama sure was proud of him.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a-a diamond as big as your shoe.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
That Johanna's not here.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
And your golden loom.
I'm gonna get my coat - I feel the breath of a storm.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
That linger in the fireball heat.
"Don't point your finger at me.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
But these to tell what's true.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
When she's better only time'll tell.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Trying to create a next world war.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
That I really did try to get close to you.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
And you must realize the danger.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
You can make it too.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
To anything I might have tried.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Looking for the places only they would know.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Thank you.
That set everybody free.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
'Cause I don't think about it.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
To the old folks' home and the college.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
And disregards the rest.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Figuring a way to get back home.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Now and forever let it be me.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
For the times, they are a-changing.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Mortality, reality.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Just what he was talking about.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
I seen a man.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
In the border-towns of despair.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
He could die happily ever after.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
All because his face was brown.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Thought I was a communist.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
There's man who swears he's not to blame.
Right now I'm having trouble.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Step lightly on the ground.
You're the only love I've ever known.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Where teardrops fall.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Hear me singing through these tears.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
So, darling, you better come through.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
We may not make it through the night.
Alright, thank you.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
But I was raised on the other.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
"Get well, get well," said she.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
But I will always be emotionally yours.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Come on, baby.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Father of love and father of rain.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
After losing every battle.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
It don't matter anyhow.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Havanageeluh.
I got nothing to go back to now.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Bid farewell forever.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Some place so high above the wall.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
We were the wrong side.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
No kindred or relative nigh.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
When I'm alone with you.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
I once loved a woman - a child, I am told.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
I only saw what they let me see.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
To hold me in your arms.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Just like so many times before.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
You don't have to be afraid.
In the brightness of my day.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
And wait for succeeding kings.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
In my Cadillac.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Throw my mattress out there too.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Crying out that he been framed.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Till I come into New York town:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
But there's one promise, darling:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Serve somebody:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Man is opposed to fair play:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
His epitaph plain:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
So many things that we never will undo;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Had to be held down by big police;
All lies and jest;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
About everybody that was hanging out;
I find complete love;
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
What can I give to You?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
When he's standing in front of you?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
What would life be?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
What do you think about that, my friend?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Poor boy, where you been?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
How much poison did they inhale?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Before you call him a man?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ready, George?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Before they're forever banned?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Across the swamp of time?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
What's wrong with you this time?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Before he can see the sky?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
For all these earthly things?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Am I ready?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Across the swooping plain?
Why and what's the reason for?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
How does it feel?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
How's everything in heaven?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Has anybody seen my love?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Can you get back in?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
To love and follow His direction?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Why would I want to take your life?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Oh, how could you refuse?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Where did you hide your halo?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
What else can a poor boy do?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
And how does it feel?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
What can I do for You?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Can I come home with you?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
How can you say he will haunt you?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Like a rolling stone?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
The love that a stranger might receive?
How can I live for You?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Of everything you see?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What good am I?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Have they missed you?
How could they let you go?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
That too many people have died?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
How many more can they afford?
By golly, what more can I say?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Gal, where you been so long?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Baby, can't you tell?
Must everybody bow?
Does anyone even try?
And one deserving of affection?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
How could they ever mistake you?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Are you ready?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Where did you lose your wings?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Too many people have died?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
When did you leave heaven?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Who you thought you were talking to?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Before it's washed to the sea?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
How many compared to yesterday?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
How many paths did they try and fail?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Before he can hear people cry?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
How many more without any reward?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
What?
How come you don't send me no regards?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Just like a rolling stone?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Silvio, silver and gold
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I live in another world
Maybe someday you will understand
Somebody seen him hanging around
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
And into the path you are hurled
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
But now something has changed
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
To see him obviously framed
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
As I stand upon the sand
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
And those whom doom and death had spared
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Just what you had in mind
But love grows old and waxes cold
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Many times I've often prayed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
And then you told me later as I apologized
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
How many times can a man turn his head
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Its iron claws attached
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Now you don't act so--so proud
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Things would be different the next time we wed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Now, a very great man once said
You used--be so proud
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
But she ain't gonna find the road
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
And things would be different the next time we wed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
There ain't nothing in this world
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Roving gambler, he was very bored
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
They took a clean-cut kid
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
I run right home and I went to bed
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
We live in a political world
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
The changes I was going through can't even be used
She let go of my hand
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
You try so hard, but you don't understand
All the sweethearts you can hold
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
It's something you did
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
I had to say something to strike him very weird
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
I've been walking around
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
But something has changed
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
While some, on principles baptized
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
And your trouble is you know it too good
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Now, whenever I get up and
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
I thought that it was well-understood
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
I'll always thank the Lord
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Either from the mountains of Madrid
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
For what you sold that's not been received
Standing on the water, casting your bread
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Nothing was delivered
He was a clean-cut kid
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Now you don't seem so proud
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
And that even the nobles get properly handled
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
So I'll make my stand
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
By no special friend
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
"Equality". I spoke the word
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
I will not go down under the ground
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I want you, baby, just to understand
Everything stays down where it's wounded
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
You used to be so amused
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
I still can remember the way that you smiled
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Just pick anyone
Though its shadow's metal badge
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
And never sat once at the head of the table
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
That she's the same one
When the roses fade
What you're gonna say when you get home
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
"That I might be gone a long, old time
"It's only you that he does crave
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
To show you something you seen before
Taking care of somebody nice
Leaving men wholly, totally free
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
If dogs run free, then what must be
What good am I then to others and me
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Little did I realize
Breaking hearts up and down the line
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Lies that life is black-and-white
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Limited in sex they dare
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Up into some paradise
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
You're not free to belong to me
All I feel is heat and flame
I'm ready for to fade
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Says it's closing time
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
When I'm all alone
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
The crashing waves roll over me
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And I would send a message
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
You say you're looking for someone
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
The man the authorities came to blame
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Mona tried to tell me
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
So I look like a walking mountain range
But I can get another one
If dogs run free, why not me
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Con you into thinking that you're the one
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
So, I called up the operator of time
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
So I remember every face
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Where I could watch her waltz for free
As he rises to fame
I am homeless, come and take me
Full of hope and desire
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
You smiling through the fence at me
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
From the start by the rule
To give the special one you seek a chance
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
There were times when I was so lonesome
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
And suddenly there appeared before me
But the first it bent and then it broke
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
When the rain is blowing in your face
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And the Negro's name
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
I do declare
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Feel to moan, but unlike before
I can survive and I can endure
They say don't come back no more
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
I rode with him in a taxi once
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
You into thinking you're the one
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
A bed that is never mine
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Knows there's no success like failure
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
And I ain't complaining none
But the dark does die
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Should I put them by your gate
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And you see why it's so unique to be
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Everybody's wearing a disguise
I'm sure you're the one to blame
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
You know, it's not even safe no more
At dawn my lover comes to me
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
A girl who would murder her own, true love
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
When Reilly's daughter got a message
He'll see by his grave
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
What's probably got you baffled more
You just pick anyone
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
We see this empty cage now corrode
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
She been gone
Just what you will say when you get home
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Should I leave them by your gate
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
What about that millionaire
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Well, it's all new to me
Among the lovely people living free
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Hunger pays a heavy price
The cause was there before we came
Remember me to the one who lives there
She plunged him into well water where
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
You could almost think that you're seeing double
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
And I'm just the same as anyone else
So up she picked her babies three
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
With all memory and fate
But I can't say I sympathize
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
And that is that one must always flush out his house
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Better stay away from those
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
But I feel nothing for their game
On the rising curve
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Remember me to one who lives there
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
While them that defend what they cannot see
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
And plenty time for good romance
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Waiting to find out what price
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
You cut to the core
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
If dogs run free, why not we
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
How many ears must one man have
I don't even notice she gone
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
It'll be with me unto the grave
You said you'd never compromise
She knows there's no success like failure
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
I been wondering all about me
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
It's all new to me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
From all the plans they do pursue
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
How was I to know you'd be the one
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Trust yourself
Oh, trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Everybody sees hisself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
The order is a-rapidly fading
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Beyond here lies nothing
She rode by night and came by morning
The order is rapidly fading
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And there's no telling who that it's naming
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
They're drinking up and walking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
Deceived me into thinking
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
The battle outside raging
There's nothing in here moving
'Cause the battle outside raging
If I was with her too long
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Early in the morning, early in the morning
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Where the time and the tempo drag
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
But then a whistle will be blowing
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
It's not a bad way to make a living
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
You left me standing in the doorway crying
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
For your weary toes to be touching
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
You go north and you go south
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Then she told us how times were tough
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I have fallen far beneath
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And how I know I'll make it through
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
The man in me will do nearly any task
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Her voice once and talk
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Well, there ain't no going back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Shoot in the back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
But they caught him and they brought him back
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
I wish she'd unlock
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
You turn around to take a final peek
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Then why don't she tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
As the last fire-truck from hell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Muttering small talk at the wall
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
He's sure got a lot of gall
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
He's taught in his school
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
How many seas must the white dove sail
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
All and all can only fall
How does it feel
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
I chased me a woman up the hill
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Soul to soul our shadows roll
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Ring bar, hard to tell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
A girl by the whirlpool
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
How many seas must a white dove sail
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Ring bell, hard to tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
A-how does it feel
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Oh, how does it feel
But I can hear another drum
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
And remain as I am
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Two eyes took the aim
"For you cannot relive them
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
You better not chew gum
Now, they asked me to read a poem
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
So, one morning when the sun was warm
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
A-she takes just like a woman
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
I'll be waiting at the station
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Yes, and someone must explain
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And she wakes just like a woman
From heights that they could not gain
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
But all their daughters put me down
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
The foreign sun, it squints upon
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
How can the life of such a man
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
There was little to say, there was no conversation
And there's no exit in any direction
In ceremonies of the horsemen
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Their religion of the little ten women
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
As they rode him in custody down to the station
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Guns and clubs followed him down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
To remember the times when I was your only man
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But me, I expected it to happen
Out of the shower comes a football man
Well, I'm hanging on
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Advertising signs that con
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Nothing we can call our own
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
For the loser now might be later to win
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
And all their daughters put me down
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
She takes just like a woman
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
In the pigpen
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
For the loser now will be later to win
He got that fortress on the mountain
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Somebody new to beat on
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And she aches just like a woman
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Why did you trade heaven
But the second mom was with the seventh son
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
She got such a sweet disposition
To my knowledge there's just one man
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
That long, black train is pulling on down
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Must meet the dawn
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Well, you fake just like a woman
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
You need something to make it known
And you ache a-just like a woman
The ones that jump on the wagon
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
But it's hard to think on
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
How many roads must a man walk down
Darkness at the break of noon
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
All their daughters put me down
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I figure maybe we're even
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
The next morning she had awoken
But the post office has been stolen
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
As you sit on the box you keep him in
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Suicide remarks are torn
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Uncle Rat went running downtown
You take just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling down
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
All lay down their bandanas and complain
"Not me," said the gambling man
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Trying to get a lead on
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
But I swear I see my reflection
She said that all the railroad men
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
My love, she's like some raven
Have died in battle or in vain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
You don't need a weatherman
Will not be understood as they're spoken
And the smell of their roses does not remain
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
And the corner sign
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Build me a boat that can carry two
All I really wanna do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
All I'd like you to do
Silvio, I gotta go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
There's nothing you can say or do
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Every place I wanna go
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Man in the coon-skin cap
I walked down there and ended up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
How many times must a man look up
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
The man in the coon-skin cap
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What good am I while you softly weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Aladdin and his lamp
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
But morning is clear
For all eternity I think I will remember
When you whispered in my ear
All you boys better run for cover
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
In one I was running and in another
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
So, don't fear if you hear
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
The wind howls like a hammer
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Never no more do I wonder
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
She took him by his long, yellow hair
The water is wide and I can’t cross over
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Alone you stand with nobody near
When only you are near
The face of God will appear
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
Still I've always kind of missed her
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I don't have to go far
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
The lover who has just walked out your door
Who came here from Cuba's door
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
At any moment you could go under
My ship is in the harbor
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
I say, "Why you say that for
Still I say her love-words over
You heard me saying a prayer for
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
For I am married to a house carpenter
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
And I don't even think about her
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
I could feel a whole lot better
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
I close my eyes and I wonder
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Don't wear sandals
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Thinking of a series of dreams
The cowboy angel rides
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
"Not me," said the man whose fists
And the princess and the prince discuss
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
And the poor white remains
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
And your father, to your sister he explains
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
But, though the masters make the rules
I try to tell it like it is
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And I try to harmonize with songs
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
They whisper in the wings
In the dimestores and bus-stations
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
The empty-handed painter from your streets
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
True love can make a blade of grass
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And tells me of her dreams
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
He's not selling any alibis
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
With a big bouquet of the roses
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
I'd gladly confess
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
You know that he has no intentions
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
And then complains
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And inside it with the people made of molasses
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
People carry roses
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Statues made of matchsticks
Six-time losers
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Well, the ragman draws circles
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Now, you must provide some answers
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
And without further notice asks you how it feels
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
What good am I if I say foolish things
I'm gonna let you pass
To memorizing politics
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Wants eleven dollar bills
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
To the cutting of fences
Don't follow leaders
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Six-time users
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
We living in times when men commit crimes
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Girl by the whirlpool's
Seven days
And, though the masters make the rules
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
You can fall down on your knees
You been hurt so many times
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Good and bad, I define these terms
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
To sharpen the senses
At times I think there are no words
That it's you and no one else that owns
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
When your mother sends back all your invitations
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
People on the platforms
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
As friends and other strangers
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Romantic facts of musketeers
You should be made to wear earphones
You never turned around to see the frowns
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Mama, you know, awaits the news
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Her window's wide open, African trees
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Glide across the lonely years
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
But still remains
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
And so Patty calls the cops
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
But, if the arrow is straight
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
He built a fire on Main Street
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
To hold each other tight
How many years can a mountain exist
I soon get some rest
With your pockets well protected at last
Well, early in the morning till late at night
To keep it in your mind and not forget
I'm moving after midnight
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
You're hearing my heart beat
In the precious winds they rot
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
One more night I will wait for the light
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Ain't it hard when you discover that
There's some people that
Johnny's in the basement
I got into the driver's seat
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Keep it in your mind and not forget
That might be all that you got
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
They tell me revenge is sweet
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
You used to laugh about
I'm on the pavement
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Well, I finally started thinking straight
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Wait for the morning light
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
She seems too far out
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
I think that it's best
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
They tell me to be discreet
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Keep me set apart
The slowest now will later be fast
You are there in the flickering light
By the way, that's a cute hat
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
You're gonna get hit
Like a corkscrew to my heart
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Our Father would not like the way that you act
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
You used to laugh-make fun about
Yet you know there is no answer fit
And I, in my armor, turning about
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
He really wasn't where it's at
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
And, since my feet are now fast
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
In the stillness of the midnight
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Plants in the bed, but
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Every new messenger bringing evil report
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
So he never thinks straight
How many years can some people exist
Without any doubt
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
One more night the moon is shining bright
Everyone still talks about
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
And the first one now will later be last
You don't forget
But, then again, there's only one I've met
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
It don't take too long to find out
Talking that the heat put
Everything is always right
The slow one now will later be fast
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
It's just crazy being here with you
To be alone with you
I can be just like you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
And I tell this truth to you
I'll remember you
I just might have to come see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
To protect you and defend you
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
I'd sure like to know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Sooner or later one of us must know
Don't it always go to show
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
It only goes to show
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
I seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Don't it always a-go to show
Well, I'd sure like to know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Down every street there's a window
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
With only you in view
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
But sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He been living there three years now
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
He seen a lot of women but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
The only one I know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
For them that think death--death's honesty
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
A cock is crowing far away
But I wish there was something you would do or say
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
That I was just a puppet in a play
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
So they took him to the infirmary
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
And it's up to you to say
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
From phony jealousy
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
But I can't deny
The Spanish-American War had its day
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
If I don't take the chance to try
She starts to speak, but he walks away
My mind weaves a symphony
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But you can never steal away
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
She puts it to me plain as day
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
So I run down most hurriedly
My ears hear a symphony
She smiles, walks the other way
Spouted out that liberty
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
She knocked upon it anyway
And the ladies treat me kindly
To those condemned to act accordingly
I did not do it harmfully
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Went to the doctor the very next day
So, I'm walking down your highway
The same thing I would want today
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
And the only tune my guitar could play
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Don't you tell Henry
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
And that which you've given me today
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
For them that must obey authority
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
I send you all my money
Maggie says that many say
That I done it the way
No, you'll not now or no other day
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Well, I'm walking down the highway
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Or if you just want some company
Is worth more than I could pay
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
And for His love they took His life away
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Well, I saw it advertised one day
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Though I'd never say
For them that think death's honesty
We banged the drum slowly
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
