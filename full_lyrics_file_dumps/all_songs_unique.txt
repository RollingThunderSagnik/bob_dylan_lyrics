Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
I wanna be yours!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Play that guitar now!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Alright, now!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Thank you!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Play fucking loud!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Alright!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
They got away!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Dignity never been photographed!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
It was the mailman!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Them Reds did it!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Start over!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Lordy, Lord!
Yes, come out your window!
Dance!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I've got a million friends!
Betty Ross!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Oh!
You're a liar!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Yeah, man!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Oh, no!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
So long, New York!
I got the freight train blues!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Hootenanny television!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Howdy, East Orange!
You must think I'm crazy!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Woo-hoo!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
Take me down to California, baby!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
My God, they killed Him!
They was all over!
He punched me out!
I ain't different than anyone!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
How they ever flood my soul!
Well!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Hope I don't find out too much!
I figured they was in my TV set!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Yippee!
Pressing on - oh, yes, I am!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
She's insane!
I've got the freight train blues!
Goodnight!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Good God!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Woo!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
I'm in love with you!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
And it's all for the love of thee."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
But we were tangled up in blue."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
But I know what you want."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
"Is it easy to forget?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
Where you and I will unite."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
And have it on Highway 61."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
It's all for the love of thee."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I would want again tomorrow."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Will mourn for your return."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"I've had too much of your company,"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
You can't blame us at all."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
They look as white as snow."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Come flowing down so free?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
I'll endow them onto thee."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
You must know about my debutante."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
So write to her tenderly."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
And pretend that you never have met."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Tangled up in blue."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
For that reason I will have to stay."
That you must always first forgive them."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"That way down Highway 61."
And hung on a willow tree."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
We'll both go home together."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Has kindly assisted me home."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
I can't find my knees."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
And punched my cigarette."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
I didn't see you around."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
You and I'll never know."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
They look as dark as night."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
We want folksingers here."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."

His old eyes deepened in his head,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,

I went into the red, went into the black,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
In the turning of twilight,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,

Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Strike another match, go start anew,
For all intended purposes,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Yes, I been gambling so long,

Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
In a pine box for all eternity,
To be out on your own,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,

You took a part of me that I really miss,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
On this new morning, new morning,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,

Give you idea that you're too good to die,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,

Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,

You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,

I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
But, if I can save you any time,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Newspapermen eating candy,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
The midnight rain follows the train,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
You've got to serve somebody,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
By losers, cheaters,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Just remember that death is not the end,
My dear, sweet friend,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Day you quit me, baby,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
If today was not a crooked highway,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Come all without, come all within,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Private reasons, great or small,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
So I got those worries blues,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
I got a wife and five little children,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
One by one until there were none,
That you'd have liked me to,
And think they're fooling you,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Try to be a success,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
He's young and on fire,
I once held her in my arms,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Don't let her see,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
The sky too is folding over you,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
To know how much I really care,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Someone to close his heart,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Holding his club like he was a king,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
She said she would always stay,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Don't you tell Henry,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
But I've been hanging on,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Winter would have no spring,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
And your streets are getting empty,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
I don't wanna meet your kin,
The country doctor rambles,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
The man in the trench-coat,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Watch the river flow,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Resent him to the bone,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
As his youth now unfolds,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
All the silver, all the gold,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
But evidently she don't,
Of ancient history,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
I just don't know what to do,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
At ships with tattooed sails,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
All you can do is do what you must,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
And I'm back in the rain,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
You broke a heart that loved you,
All I really wanna do,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
If you'd see me this way,
So unknown,
They say every distance is not near,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Who could they get to carry you,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Father of day, father of night,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Look out, kid,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
How many a year has passed and gone,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
It's alright,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
And played the fife lowly,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
While riding on a train going west,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
I been riding the midnight train,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
She once was a true love of mine,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
You want watered-down love,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Automobile coming into style,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
I'm leaving today,
You came down on me like white thunder,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Get back, write Braille,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Had no one to go my bail,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
They say every man must fall,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
With no direction home,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But the time ain't tall,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
They--they show me to the door,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
I got my mind made up,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Yesterday's just a memory,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Well, I been gambling so long,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
All that and more and then some,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Precious father, loving mother,
The only son of God Almighty,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Well, I can't understand,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
A hand set the spark,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
I love you, pretty baby,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Drifting too far from shore,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
"Not me," said his manager,
To gather flowers constantly,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Oh, Angelina,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
In the ruins of your balcony,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Giving back all of what you owe,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Don't follow leaders,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Over your senses you have no control,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
This situation can only get rougher,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
You have explained every mystery,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Watching the river flow,
In the shadows of moonlight,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
The day would surely have to break,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
They say that every man must fall,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
We'll fly the night away,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
In love and with kindness,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
But now morning is clear,
Is looking for a new fool,
And it's only that I'm asking,
As the present now will later be past,
Makes no difference where she's been,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
And forget my pride,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
And I'm just like that bird,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
China doll, alcohol,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
I'll be on my way,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Socialism, hypnotism,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
But it would not be new,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Pick you up every time you fall,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
The kingdoms of experience,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
They say everything can be replaced,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Who among them would try to impress you,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Dream about you, baby,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
See you fly or watch you die,
But, if you want me to,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
I try my best to be like I am,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Tell me that you love me only,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
With his fist in a clinch,
Love that's pure no accident,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Look away, you rolling river,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
With what your fate is going to be,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
"Not I," said the referee,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
People talk of situations,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
They don't believe in mercy,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
The sky too is folding under you,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
God knows how to make it flow,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Don't matter what you did,
To be one your own,
Front door shut, back door too,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
To have--be on your own,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Poor boy never say die,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
That long, black train is pulling down,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
They say every man need protection,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
You find God in the church of your choice,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
But, deep inside my heart,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
I got the worried blues,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
A dream about you, baby,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Carry the New York Times,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
And the point is slick,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
By the night and been to some place new,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
For her to arrive,
Cares not to come up any higher,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Wasn't making any great connection,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Father of black, father of white,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
The human mind can only stand so much,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Where I will always be renewed,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
And there's two white horses following me,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
I threw it all away,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
As I travel down life's pathway,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Stone you and say good luck,
You gotta look some other place,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Without ideals or violence,
And you make love just like a woman,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Like a complete unknown,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
She got great big hind legs,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Is used, it is plain,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
True love, they've been without it,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
They must bust in early May,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Of this I can't say very much,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
For the politician's gain,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
May be living in another country under another name,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
But it ain't me, babe,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
One by one they followed the sun,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
By users, cheaters,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
God knows everything,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Well, I'm so glad,
My woman needs it every day,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Without a love of my own,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Well, I don't mind dying,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Forever young, forever young,
Icicles hanging down,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Is it really any wonder,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
The air is getting hotter,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Honey, just for you to climb,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
To shine in through,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
That must be what it's all about,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Loneliness, tenderness,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
That the laws are with him,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Drag you down or drain you down,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Don't try No Doz,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
I think we better talk this over,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
First degree and second degree,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
I could have left this town by noon,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
And, on their promises of paradise,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Wanna thank You, Lord,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Hang around the ink-well,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Living in the land of Nod,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
For the wise men and the fools,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Ain't no going back,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
It's rising up above my head,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
When the night comes falling,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
I know I can't win,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
My love, she speaks softly,
Without your sweet love,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
To your tambourine in time,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
I wish tonight were here,
The country music station plays soft,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
He won't do nothing to you,
I'll go see them come down my way,
When I was in Missouri,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
The haunted, frightened trees,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Try hard, get barred,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
To strict party-platform ties,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I went into the city, went into the town,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Make you spin or do you in,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Friends with you,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Says he's got a bad bill,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Every head is so dignified,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Want you so bad,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
It's really something,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Broken threads, broken springs,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
But it ain't him to blame,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Into my own parade,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Not the end, not the end,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
She leave by the other and roam,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
And I got those worried blues,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
They run a brick and tile company,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Don't let yourself fall,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
And she'll be coming forth,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
That foreign sound in your ear,
My senses have been stripped,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
In the great unknown,
Well, the job that you used to have,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
And, although that we're single and free,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Stand up straight and tall,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
The light I never knowed,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Only one thing I did wrong,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Strangers all give me the news,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Far away and over the wall,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
I want my arms around you,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
That fired the gun,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Adios, mi corazon,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Just like I did before,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Like you never did before,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
He been around the world and back again,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
How does it feel,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
I just can't do what I've done before,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
By rivers of blindness,
We live in a political world,
I've been around this whole country,
A man named Martin Luther King,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
She said she would never forget,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
And come every time you call,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Yes, and I'll go last,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I want you so bad,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Where mercy walks the plank,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
You better duck down the alleyway,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Fare thee well but for a while,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Badge out, laid off,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
I bless the day I found you,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Nothing was delivered,
Joey, Joey,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I can't be good, baby,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
So glad,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
It's too bad he had to go,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
For she ain't the same,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Well, come all without, come all within,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
The wind blowing the snow around,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Well, well, well,
Well, I gave you all my money,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Searching everywhere I know,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
She's opened up a happy home,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
They say every man must need protection,
Three angels up above the street,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
But the bottles are done,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
You can raise up your right hand,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Precious angel under the sun,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
I'd be sad and blue,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
I don't want to meet your kin,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
And to come every time you call,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
But I know that he don't talk,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
You have laid down Your life for me,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Madams light the candles,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
And every cause that ever I fought,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
You have given me life to live,
Oh, singing just for you,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I want you,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
If I didn't have to guess,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Relationships of ownership,
All the tired horses in the sun,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Go melt back in the night,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Oh, watered-down love,
But, if I will save you the time,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Don't mind the driving rain,
You need something to open up a new door,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
To hang and to lynch,
Don't let me change my heart,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
And they--they look at me and frown,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
He's the property of Jesus,
You can run down to the desert,
Why she did go,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
People carry roses,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
And, though the line is cut,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Six months on the chain gang,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Tell her not to worry,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Said I'm pressing on,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Everything's a-hers or his,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Gonna serve somebody,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Don't ever try to change me,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
When there is no more,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
It always means so much,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Go away from my window,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
They pass by so silently,
It all seemed so well-timed,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
You don't have to feed me,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
When I seen him lose control,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
And it still ain't me, babe,
But, to remain as friends,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Baby, please stop crying,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Better jump down a manhole,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
To be on your own,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
No, nothing was delivered,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Oh, see what you can do,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Like some mystery,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
And I'm in the shade,
Don't wear sandals,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Don't let her hear,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
In the instant that I preach,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
You have given me eyes to see,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Watered-down love,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
God knows it's a struggle,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
I'm gonna let you pass,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Like as not, it's better so,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Simplify you, classify you,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
I went into the city, into the town,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
I had no one for to go my bail,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
We take great delight in our own company,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Give you my money, honey,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
The Second World War came to an end,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
If ever I prove false to you,
Get dressed, get blessed,
I long to see you in the morning light,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Father of night, father of day,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
I would not feel so all alone,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
A million faces at my feet,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Heart of mine,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Memory, ecstasy,
Far past the frozen leaves,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Don't tie no bows,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Bring the wife and family,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
And, if I can save you any time,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
They keep it all hid,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Spent my money on you, honey,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
It always has hit me from below,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Mercury, gravity,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Five by five they tried to survive,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Hold me, baby, be near,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Carved next to his name,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
And may you stay forever young,
The phone's tapped anyway,
We never much thought we could get very old,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Over the hills and far away,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
That fellow who never blushes,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I went down where the vultures feed,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
The night passed away so quickly,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Like a dog on a chain,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Three by three they're turning the key,
You always responded when I needed your help,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
You got to serve somebody,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Well, I may just swear,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Circled by the circus sands,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Advertising signs, they con,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
I got two white horses following me,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
And to come each time you call,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
I'm going down the river,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
And not going through any great extreme,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
That they do not respect in any degree,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
Just like a rolling stone,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Get born, keep warm,
Puffing on a big cigar,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
I'm never, never far from home,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Oxford Town around the bend,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Going,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Serve somebody,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Just don't know what to do,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
You married young just like your ma,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
You better chew gum,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Precious memories, how they linger,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Went back home to the yard,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Far away in the stormy night,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
You made it there somehow,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
And ye shall be a-changed,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
I went out last night to take a little round,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
And I got the worried blues,
At the close of the day,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
They tell me every man must fall,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
True love of mine,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Going, going,
I been good,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Ye shall be changed,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
If you can't quit your sinning,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Mixing up the medicine,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
God knows there's a chance,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Thinking about the government,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
From their fates try to resign,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Stripping away at it all,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And it's like I ain't here,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
I had so much left to do,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Bringing me all of your charms,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
The joint is jumping,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
May you stay forever young,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
If you must cling to someone,
It was you who came right through,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Need a woman all the time,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I got those worried blues,
We've killed each one,
Got me a secret membership card,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
And point away from the past,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Seven days,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
In the little church a-this side of town,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
She would have married me,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Who will promise never to part,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Without a dream in my heart,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
God don't call it treason,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
But you try with your whole soul,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Thieving in the alley,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
And, if I see the day,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
You got something better,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
I can change, I swear,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
The night would see me wide awake,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
To be--direction home,
And also by his feet,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Give what I got until I got no more,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
God knows there's a heaven,
People talk over situations,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Looking 'bout the government,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Hmm, I can make it through,
God knows it's a crime,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Look who's back in town,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Went to the station down in the yard,
The winter would hold no spring,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
But I'm pressing on,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Wintertime in New York town,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
And I don't want to drag you down,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
In one the surface was frozen,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
This world is ruled by violence,
Never did feel this way before,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
I'm going out of my mind,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Ever since I been a child,
God knows there's a purpose,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
And gathering storms may arise,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Going, going, gone,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Whether you are right or wrong,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
See her in that very tight skirt,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Someone to open each and every door,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
I found my world, found my world in you,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
That can do what's never been done,
New morning,
Yesterday is just a memory,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Can't find what I need,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Too noble to neglect,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Out to the windy beach,
And it ain't me, babe,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
As human gods aim for their mark,
You don't want a love that's pure,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
I'd only have to stay,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Laying low,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Thank You, Lord,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
And on the highway of regret,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
And you know I could never be your own,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
All them prophets good and gone,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Searching high, searching low,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
To stay closer than any friend,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
And the whole world is on your case,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
But something has changed,
A complete unknown,
You'll change your last name, too,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Stay away from the train line,
Since you've been gone,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Poor boy dressed in black,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I won't have my nature way,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
You to me were true,
When you think that you've lost everything,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Keep me where you are,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
People going down to the ground,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Eh, singing just for you,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
It's not aimed at anyone,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
So, never leave me lonely,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
The day you quit me, baby,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
And joined the John Birch Society,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
It was from her ship sailing,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Yet every distance is not near,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
You can hear them tires squeal,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Trouble,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
I've been in and out of happiness,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
And here I sit so patiently,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
God knows you've got to weep,
Tears on the letter that I write,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Or have done something wrong,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
If not for you,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
When all will be well,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
God knows it's true,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Where the neon madmen climb,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
It's like I ain't here,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
The beat is pumping,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
You were striped, you were plain,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I went back home, put on my tie,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
To be without a home,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
God knows there's a river,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
How he died nobody could say,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Father of air and father of trees,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
To be alone with you,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Couldn't even see the floor,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
In the hills of mystery,
Keep a clean nose,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
You and me, we had completeness,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Want you,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
You even make love just like a woman,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Had a dream about you, baby,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
And give him back the time he's done,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
I have no one to meet,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
You have given all there is to give,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Never weak, but always strong,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
To hide 'neath a hood,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
I can make it through,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Don't let me drift too far,
You wanna drown love,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Up and down the block,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
I get my sweet reward,
Too serious to fool,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I try my best to be just like I am,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Under the microscope,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
You will search, babe, at any cost,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
You're beautiful to me,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
If'n you don't know by now,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Trust yourself,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
He is centuries old,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
And I'm so glad,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
To a solid rock,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
God knows it's outta sight,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
That her father was going to hang,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
You stole her love from me one day,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
If you throw it all away,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
For something that he never done,
Waiting for the trains,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Aim well, my little one,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
There's always someone who understands,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
And, if anybody asks me,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Or select you or dissect you,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Take the motherless children off the street,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Vanished from my hand,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Made of silver or of golden,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Grandpa died last week,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
God knows that, when you see it,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Pressing on,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
But he can't be blamed,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Eh, see what you can do,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
He's not selling any alibis,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I should have left this town this morning,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
To be so useless and all,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
I got no place left to turn,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Roll, Willie, roll,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Till both of us fell by the way,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
I can't understand,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
One by one they follow the sun,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I rambled out of New York town,
Light yourself a candle,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
And you take just like a woman,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
But you were gambling for support,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I just say no thanks,
If anything is gonna sell,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
My limbs are shaking,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
My arms and legs were broken,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
A thousand miles from home,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
The one we can see and can feel,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Don't know what to do without it,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
She never does me wrong,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Got my mind made up,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Human gods aim for their mark,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
But you're doing it again,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Now you don't talk so loud,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Loyalty, unity,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Courage is a thing of the past,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Speaking to some French girl,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
I been good while I been waiting,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
They walk among the stately trees,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Just then the order came to charge,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
"Come along and take a trip,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I never can go because, you know,
Judge and jury took their stand,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
To protect his white skin,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
There she come, now, down my way,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
I'm so glad,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
It still ain't me, babe,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Each one playing a horn,
Broken idols, broken heads,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
I just keep pressing on,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Analyze you, categorize you,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
For his age he is wise,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I got a bird that whistles,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
They took a clean-cut kid,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Love don't have any place,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
They say every man needs protection,
More people kept a-piling on,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
While paupers change possessions,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
With the juice running down my leg,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Using every angle under the sun,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
It's a price I have to pay,
Don't let her know,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
It could even be like a myth,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
God knows when,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Read books, repeat quotations,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Face full of black soot,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
I tried to reach you, honey,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
I just don't see why I should even care,
With a killer's pride, security,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Corrina, Corrina,
I thank the Lord,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
And the table's full and overflowed,
It don't matter what you did,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
A handle hid out in the dark,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
I can see the turning of the key,
One more night the stars are in sight,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
If she ain't feeling well,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Baby, let me follow you down,
I need a shot of love,
In the darkness of my night,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
To keep up his hate,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Far away from it all,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Better jump down the manhole,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
A man with a badge skips by,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
You will be alright, girl,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Go down to the river, babe,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
To find out if she's talked,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Saved,
Each time we meet, love,
You had enough of hatred,
We'll go someplace unknown,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Nothing too very scientific,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
It hurts me, too,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
In his anger and his shame,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
I fell down to my bended knees,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
God knows it's fragile,
I've been saved - well, alright,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
And I know what you're thinking of,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
I like the cool way you look at me,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Looking for a new fool,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
God don't call it wrong,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Staying far behind without you,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
In the end,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
On the stone that remains,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Going home,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
I shall be released,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I'd already gone the distance,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
God sees it all unfold,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
May be an actor in a plot,
They lowered him down as a king,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Every brain is civilized,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
And I--I walk out on my own,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
She'll surely turn to white,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
When she lays upon the grass,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Heart of mine, be still,
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
With no other choice except but for to go -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
I got no idea what I want -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
Disconnect these cables--
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Turn, turn, turn again -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Seven more years I longed to have her -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
Remember me to one who lives there -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
First degree and second degree -
Private reasons - great or small -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
I'm sure it was not three -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
How badly they were shocked -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
Hava-na-
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
It can't be this way everywhere -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
Thank--
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
As suicide remarks are torn -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Havanagee-luh-
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
Whispering your secret emotion -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
You will not hear a laugh -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
I long to hold you in the night -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
Democracy don't rule the world --
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
With notions his canoe was laden -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
I hope that you can hear--
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
Hang out the whole next day -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
Indians camp along her border -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Ten thousand miles or more -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
Havana-gee-
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
Haven't seen her since that night -
To know where you are -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
That can win what's a-never been won -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
Ha-va-
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
That's where you belong --
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
Leave all the children home -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
Oh, my-
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
I a-hope you can hear--
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
Just what this song is all about.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
And every window made of glass.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
And one day he came passing by.
Your son is coming back from the war.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
I used to care, but things have changed.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
For the saving grace that's over me.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
It's just the same as talking to you.
While my conscience explodes.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
But you break just like a little girl.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Friends with you.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
When he played and we didn't dance.
You don't have to be afraid.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
My mind is breaking.
His voice was low with pain.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
I've made shoes for everyone - even you - while I still go barefoot.
I have heard rumors all over town.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
What you'll say when you get home.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the--lonely still.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Up and down the lonesome town.
You're a big girl all the way.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
You always got more than enough rope.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
I don't care what in the world you do.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
But you're back where you belong.
And I need you, yeah.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
She once was a true love of mine.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
Oh, yes, they did.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
This kind of love, I-I'm lovesick.
And they gotta cut something.
And guarded them as they fell.
I said that.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Buildings going up to the sky.
The night will soon be gone.
The National Guard stands around the door.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Fighting every inch of the way.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
There's no words that need to be said.
Step lightly on the ground.
I don't believe you.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Lay dead beside him there.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
A man named Martin Luther King...
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
He's only a pawn in their game.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
I's looking around just to see myself.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Living down Sonora way.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
You know the song in my heart.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Under the hedges.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
For as long as love will last.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
And I'll rock you too.
I hear them semis rolling too.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
Put me outta doors.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
I know they're not what they seem.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
Without ideals or violence.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Then the mailman comes in - even he's gotta take a side.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
Feel further away than ever before.
I got a woman in Jackson - oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
If it just don't make me hurts.
Try to avoid the scandals.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
But you can't see in and I--it's hard looking out.
For the times, they-they are a-changing.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
The next day could be your last.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
And rivers that ran through every day.
I'm gonna get my coat - I feel the breath of a storm.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
The National Guard stands around his door.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
And there's no time to think.
Hmm.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
And you only got ten.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Last radio is playing.
I'll hold it down for you.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
'Cause I don't think about it.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
I'd like to know.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
With an iron chain around his neck.
It's just the old American way.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Everybody's having them dreams.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
That old ship was a-going down.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
To keep her from the howling winds.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
I know you always say that you agree.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
She can't find him anywhere.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
I just can't beg you anymore.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
In the border-towns of despair.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
And tapestry of rhyme.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Because everybody must get stoned.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
If you just let me follow you down.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
Carry for you deep down inside.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
But all I see are dark eyes.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Neighborhood bully.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
That's really and truly an American.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.

When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Baby, baby...
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.

He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.

Until my dying-day.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.

Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
Far down the street we stray.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.

Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Some speak of the future.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
I find it so difficult to leave.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
I can't fire them anymore.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
I can't shoot them anymore.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
Things will be alright by and by.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.

Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
I'll remember you.
What looks like the easy way out.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
And the mailbox is locked.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.

So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Gonna serve somebody.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
Like you never done before.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
I always thought that he was well.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Must be and that is all.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Leading me, going home.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Find out something only dead men know.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
And no time to think.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.

Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.

Someday gonna need my help, someday.
On this new morning with you.

The holy one called Jesus Christ.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.

They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.

You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Billy, you been running for so long.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.

Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Someone I really could care for.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Her fond face pale with woe.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.

Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.

I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
By that soft and shining sea.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.

If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
You sound like a hillbilly.

And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
To be alone with you.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
There were six thousand people there.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Well, I'm just thumping.

"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.

Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Food was flying everywhere - I left without my hat.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Said it was a bad dream.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
To reach of your rattling drums.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.

Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
And there's a slow--there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.

But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
With gold and silver in her hand.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And each one I've never seen again.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
I stood wondering which way to go.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
And I need you, ah.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.

I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
I want you.

If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Join the army if you fail.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
That must be what it's all about.

Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
If not for you.
Six by six...
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.

And your golden loom.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
It was you who understood.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Is what this thing here is for.
I'm a poet, I know it.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
An innocent man in a living hell.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
I think this time we should escape.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Turned on my record player.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
You don't want me, give my money back.
He could die happily ever after.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Just like you've always smiled before.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
My love winks, she does not bother.
She just acts like we never have met.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
I will only let you down.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
For me to return to or chase.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
"Don't trill no news on me.
And you--you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
You won't get it for money.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
They're all gonna take on down by the bounded bank.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
But I would never do you wrong.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
Thank you.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
When you go your way and I go mine.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
I got nothing to go back to now.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
She saw her father's body broken.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
That can win what's never been won.
She pretends like we never have met.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
You can make it too.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I--but I just don't know how.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Lost time is not found again.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
Don't remember one thing more.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
And the Santa Fe.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
Blowing through another no-good town.
My baby took my heart from me.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Oh, her darling love she found.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
You got a heart of stone.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
We may not make it through the night.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Baby, baby.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Even the softest touch.
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Saying wants company.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Honey, baby.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
The hour that the ship comes in.
I don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
68, but says he's 24.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
Come on, darling.
You to me were the best.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
To the sin of love's false security.
Know not what the years may hold.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
I got trouble in my mind.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
On the caboose of the train.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Everything inside is made of stone.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
I just can't see through it anymore.
She's in some foreign land.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Patriotism, materialism.
Good car to drive, after a war.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Mama, you been on my mind.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
But she had some way of finding them out.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
That brave and devoted band.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
But the fighter still remains.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby...
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
That keep us so tightly bound.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
May you stay forever young.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
But with the country to where you're going.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
It always does when you're with me.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Lord, protect my child.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
At the sorority sisters' home.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Life don't mean a thing.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
And he was a friend of mine.
In the night the price was paid.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
See that my grave is kept clean.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Everybody that was hanging out.
My face you'll never see no more.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Mama, you are on my mind.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Using ideas as my maps.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
To anything I might've tried.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
The words that her lover had said.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
The last radio is playing.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're-what you are but what you're not.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
To which a scoundrel clings.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Close your eyes, close the door.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Nothing done and nothing said.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
He never did know what it was all about.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
I'll only let you down.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Just crying out that he was framed.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
"And stay all night with me.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
The hour when the ship comes in.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Evidently she won't.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
I been worrying about you, baby.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Looking for a new friend.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And the sails are spread.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
To kill with no pain.
Now you don't talk so loud.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
If you just let me come home with you.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Take me as I am or let me go.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
That last night I was with.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Now and forever let it be me.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Father of love and father of rain.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Hope I don't blow it.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Drifting too far from shore.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
They got him on conspiracy - they were never sure who with.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
With your golden loom.

He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
It can't be this way everywhere.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Alright, thank you very much.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
He ain't-a got no name.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
That Johanna's not here.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
I'm younger than that now.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
I don't know.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Mortality, reality.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
But these to tell what's true.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
When my working day's through.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
They both rode off together.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
In this concrete world full of souls.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Foundationed deep somehow.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
But I know that I can't move.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
But the mountains of the past.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
The country doctor rambles.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Have fallen from her curls.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
And she'll only know he's dead.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Down along my restless palms.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Who always was too proud to beg.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Crying out that he been framed.
Is just equality in school.
Ever since we've been apart.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
People bending broken rules.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Greenwich Village.
To see that you're madly in love.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Where teardrops fall.
And left me here facing the wall.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
You're a big girl now.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
I did not do it knowingly.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
You only got ten.
Without a love of my own.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Most of the time.
Down to New Orleans.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
And disregards the rest.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
As if a wedding vow.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
I followed the winding stream.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
For an instant hand touched hand.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
I'm falling in love with you.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Just to take somebody's money away.
I once held her in my arms.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Everything is broken.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Trouble...
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
And keep away from pranks.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Going, going, gone.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Is gonna be against the law.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Lay your hand upon my head.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
Until I threw it all away.
I remember her whispering yet.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
Of every man who put me here.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
If I ride back again.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
Baby, please come home.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
That I left in the French Quarter.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
She said she would always stay.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Everything is gonna be alright.
I needed somebody to talk to.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
But I can't get close to her at all.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
They would not let me be.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
And time is beginning to crawl.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.

You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Than people who are most content.
Hope that it don't sleet.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Trying to create a next world war.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Alright, thank you.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Got ice water in my veins.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Gal, you're on my mind.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
And I'll go last.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.

You give something up for everything you gain.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley - that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this-this is a song-this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Don't have to look no further - you're the soul of many things.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
When my memory is not so short.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.

A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
So, darling, you better come through.
All because of the color of his skin.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.

That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.

The sooner you can leave.
And make promises by the hours.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.

Looking for the places only they would know.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
While evening slips away.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Unless they're from another world.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
In fond memory appear.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
I'm not the one you need.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
At the end of the trail.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
I know the kinds of things you like.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
And the morning will be breaking.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
You break your promise all over the place.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Well, our captain, he is dead - died for a maid.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Slowly into autumn.
No kindred or relative nigh.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
But he sure left here in style.
Never been so easy or so slow.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Some place so high above the wall.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
I just can't do what I done before.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
And the night blows rainy.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
It's that million dollar bash.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Soft as music, light as spring.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
And ye shall be changed.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Broken voices on broken phones.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
Memories of what used to be.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
I know something is changed.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
I would only let you down.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
"Don't point your finger at me.
"And light on my right knee.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Hoping you'll come through too.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
I seen a man.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
The sooner you can go.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Your voice was all that I heard.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
Duality, mortality.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Got my mind made up.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
In the palace of the Pope.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
I only saw what they let me see.
See like me or be like me.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Wants to get it paid off.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
And the pearls are from Japan.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
That big, old boat started to sink.
And I's left alone with three children.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Magic in a magical land.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Oh, convey herself away.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
In the dark land of the sun.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
To live it you had to explode.
And discovered her invisible self.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
I can't hear you anymore.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
For that's the way I remember her best.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Adios, mi corazon.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
You're bound to fall" - you thought they were all kidding you.
And it never seemed strange.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Honey, I want you.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
You're my honey.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
Going back where we come from.
The whole world is my throne.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
But I ain't neither one.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Someone to open each and every door.
Standing on your window, honey - yes, I've been here before.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Trust yourself.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
But I was raised on the other.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
Bid farewell forever.
And your highway's getting filled.
And then unto eternity.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Under the midnight moon.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
That set everybody free.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Epitome, rigidity.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Who says she knows me well.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
To know which way the wind blows.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Till your error you clearly learn.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
I'm going where I never been before.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Honey, come and see about me.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
You're my baby.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
That I really did try to get close to you.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Chain you down or bring you down.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I can walk anytime around the block.
So many people I never saw in my life.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Please let me ride you home.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
And I want you to be that woman.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
And come away with me.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
But simply because it's true.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Kisses she gave him three.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
They want me for a gambling fight.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
My love, she speaks softly.
You don't have to worry any more.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
So long, honey babe.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
I hope you're ready.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
His mama sure was proud of him.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
'Steada acting like we never met.

That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Nobody stops to ask why.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
And that failure's no success at all.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Hope you're ready.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Walking around with no one else.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
We were the wrong side.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.

And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
I just can't keep from crying.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
Throw my ticket in the wind.
Even before you came in the door.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Rode slowly back again.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.

You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.

At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".

Just you and me.

Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
I couldn't see what you could show me.

I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
Good as I been to you.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
To anything I mighta tried.

I hate bears.

Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
It runs both cold and deep.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
High society, notoriety.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Sound like it's on a final run.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.

Up the steps into the nearest bank.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.

She made well sure her neighbors understood.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.

Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
But, baby, please stop crying--it's tearing up my mind.

And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl - and me - oh, God! - I'm a one.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Rain would gather too.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.

Chain you down or be your clown.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
I never saw the man again.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.

Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
Dollar a day's worth.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.

And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.

And gives it to me for a song.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Yes, tell me.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
He's got his mother's eyes.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
And I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
So quickly into autumn.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Ever since I seen her smile.
I froze right to the bone.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Just what he was talking about.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Thought I was a communist.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Finalize you or advertise you.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
God knows...
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Or inspect you or reject you.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You'll do as much for me.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Thanks.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
In the brightness of my day.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
Drink up your blood like wine.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
With the golden loom.
You'd better get that in your head.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
Oh, Angelina.
It only brings me sorrow.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
And crime don't have a face.
Blood on your saddle.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
But my heart just won't give in.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
I hope I'm ready.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
Tried to create a next world war.
For there's a slow--said there's a slow, slow train coming.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
And I've never been too impressed.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Some place so high above this wall.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
New morning.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Waiting on my burying ground.
Going through all these things twice.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
In my Cadillac.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
With all these promises you left for me.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
I had so little time to fail.
I didn't realize how young you were.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Leave no stone unturned.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Someone who will die for you and more.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Oh, got my mind made up.
See him at play makes me smile.
You're the only love I've ever known.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
Or put up against the wall.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Havanageeluh.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
It don't matter anyhow.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
I just go pump on it some.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And all your raging glory.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Rain would gather, too.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Somebody better investigate soon.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Throw my mattress out there too.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
You're gonna need my help someday.

At my window with a broken wing.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.

Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.

I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
The whole night through.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
I'm sailing away in the morning.

And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.

I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.

As the present now will later be past.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.

Behind a man's brain.
You can't win with a losing hand.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.

And it makes me feel so sorry.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.

You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
That number eleven was closing.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
The place that I started from.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Police at your back.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
But it was more than I could do.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Humility, simplicity.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
Crying out that he was framed.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
He's always on trial for just being born.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Bring that bottle over here.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Everybody must get stoned.
To see what kinda words he could say.
It'll never do, somehow.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Tangled up in blue.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
At not getting their money's worth.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Mine alone.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
While I'm in the hall.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
They don't make nothing here no more.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Gone as the season she's taken.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
I had something to protect.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Yeah, serve somebody:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Serve somebody:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
But there's one promise, darling:
Man is opposed to fair play:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Till I come into New York town:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
His epitaph plain:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
All lies and jest;
Make promises by the hour;
Some speak of the future;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Crumble into one another;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Had to be held down by big police;
I find complete love;
So many things that we never will undo;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Does anyone even try?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Don't you remember making baby love?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
What can I give to You?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
What?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Why would I want to take your life?
For all these earthly things?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Before he can see the sky?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Of everything you see?
Am I still dreaming yet?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Baby, what more can I tell?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
How could they let you go?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Where did you lose your wings?
What would life be?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Before they're allowed to be free?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
So I can know if I'm really real?
How can you say he will haunt you?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
How many compared to yesterday?
When did you leave heaven?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
To love and follow His direction?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Just like a rolling stone?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Ready, George?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
How many more can they afford?
Who killed Davey Moore?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
By golly, what more can I say?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
The love that a stranger might receive?
That too many people have died?
How's everything in heaven?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
How many more without any reward?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Has anybody seen my love?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Gal, where you been so long?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Where did you hide your halo?
Have they missed you?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
What good am I?
Am I ready?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Just what in the world has come over you?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
But who did I see but the one I love?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Too many people have died?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Before they're forever banned?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
When he's standing in front of you?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Must everybody bow?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Are you ready?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
What else can a poor boy do?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
And how does it feel?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
Are you the same person that was here before?
And one deserving of affection?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
How does it feel?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
How can I live for You?
What can I do for You?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Poor boy, where you been?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Before he can hear people cry?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Can I come home with you?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Before it is washed to the sea?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Like a rolling stone?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
How much poison did they inhale?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Why and what's the reason for?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
What's wrong with you this time?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Who's gonna let it roll?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
How long are we gonna be riding?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Across the swamp of time?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
Can you get back in?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Across the swooping plain?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
How could they ever mistake you?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Baby, can't you tell?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
But am I still dreaming yet?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Before you call him a man?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
To see him obviously framed
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
And then you told me later as I apologized
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Nothing was delivered
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
I've been walking around
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
I thought that it was well-understood
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
While some, on principles baptized
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Silvio, silver and gold
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I want you, baby, just to understand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
But something has changed
Things would be different the next time we wed
And into the path you are hurled
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
The changes I was going through can't even be used
How many times can a man turn his head
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Either from the mountains of Madrid
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Now you don't seem so proud
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Maybe someday you will understand
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
There ain't nothing in this world
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
I'll always thank the Lord
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
You used--be so proud
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
They took a clean-cut kid
Somebody seen him hanging around
And that even the nobles get properly handled
I live in another world
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
So I'll make my stand
But now something has changed
He was a clean-cut kid
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Just what you had in mind
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
And things would be different the next time we wed
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
As I stand upon the sand
I will not go down under the ground
All the sweethearts you can hold
He wagged his tail and shook his head
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
For what you sold that's not been received
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
By no special friend
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Its iron claws attached
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
You used to be so amused
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
But all that suffering was not to be compared
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
We live in a political world
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
And your trouble is you know it too good
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Many times I've often prayed
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Now, whenever I get up and
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Roving gambler, he was very bored
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
Now, a very great man once said
"Equality". I spoke the word
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
And those whom doom and death had spared
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
She let go of my hand
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
I run right home and I went to bed
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Now you don't act so--so proud
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
But she ain't gonna find the road
Everything stays down where it's wounded
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
It's something you did
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
And plenty time for good romance
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
You cut to the core
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Feel to moan, but unlike before
That she's the same one
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
So, I called up the operator of time
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
All I feel is heat and flame
From the Golden Gate Bridge
But the dark does die
The cause was there before we came
I can survive and I can endure
And never sat once at the head of the table
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
She knows there's no success like failure
Up into some paradise
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Well, it's all new to me
When the rain is blowing in your face
What about that millionaire
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
I been wondering all about me
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
I'm ready for to fade
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Says it's closing time
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
What's probably got you baffled more
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Maybe someday you will look back and see
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
"It's only you that he does crave
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
When the roses fade
It's all new to me
"That I might be gone a long, old time
She been gone
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Well, six white horses that you did promise
And I ain't complaining none
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
I'm sure you're the one to blame
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
But I can get another one
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
And I would send a message
But it won't be over till they clear his name
See the primitive wallflower freeze
You said you'd never compromise
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
With all memory and fate
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Remember me to the one who lives there
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Leaving men wholly, totally free
On the rising curve
As he rises to fame
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
But I feel nothing for their game
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
If dogs run free, why not me
Breaking hearts up and down the line
You're not free to belong to me
Lies that life is black-and-white
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Remember me to one who lives there
From the start by the rule
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
How many ears must one man have
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
To give the special one you seek a chance
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Full of hope and desire
Taking care of somebody nice
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Knows there's no success like failure
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I rode with him in a taxi once
You smiling through the fence at me
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
But I can't say I sympathize
When Reilly's daughter got a message
If dogs run free, why not we
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Should I leave them by your gate
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Just pick anyone
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Where I could watch her waltz for free
And her silver-studded phantom cause
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
From all the plans they do pursue
What good am I then to others and me
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
So I remember every face
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
You know, it's not even safe no more
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
A bed that is never mine
What you're gonna say when you get home
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
They say don't come back no more
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And you see why it's so unique to be
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
He'll see by his grave
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
While them that defend what they cannot see
I don't even notice she gone
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
"Oh, father, you will surely die
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Mona tried to tell me
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Should I put them by your gate
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Though its shadow's metal badge
I do declare
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
And I'm just the same as anyone else
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
And the Negro's name
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
And suddenly there appeared before me
Waiting to find out what price
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
When I'm all alone
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
To show you something you seen before
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Looking at hands for the lines that were
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
It'll be with me unto the grave
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
If dogs run free, then what must be
How was I to know you'd be the one
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
I am homeless, come and take me
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Why wait any longer for the one you love
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
You say you're looking for someone
Among the lovely people living free
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
There were times when I was so lonesome
The crashing waves roll over me
Limited in sex they dare
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Little did I realize
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
You could almost think that you're seeing double
The man the authorities came to blame
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
She plunged him into well water where
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Better stay away from those
We see this empty cage now corrode
Just what you will say when you get home
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
At dawn my lover comes to me
You into thinking you're the one
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
So up she picked her babies three
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
You just pick anyone
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
And that is that one must always flush out his house
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
So I look like a walking mountain range
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Hunger pays a heavy price
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Trust yourself
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
The order is rapidly fading
The battle outside raging
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
You left me standing in the doorway crying
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
I can hear their hearts a-beating
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And there's no telling who that it's naming
The order is a-rapidly fading
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
For your weary toes to be touching
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Where the time and the tempo drag
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
But then a whistle will be blowing
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
It's not a bad way to make a living
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
She rode by night and came by morning
There's nothing in here moving
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
If I was with her too long
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Well, I set my monkey on the log
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Beyond here lies nothing
Deceived me into thinking
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
'Cause the battle outside raging
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
For your weary toes to be a-touching
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
They're drinking up and walking
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
I have fallen far beneath
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Then she told us how times were tough
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
And how I know I'll make it through
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Look out, the saints are coming through
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
The man in me will do nearly any task
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Shoot in the back
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Her voice once and talk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
You turn around to take a final peek
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
I wish she'd unlock
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Make everything from toy guns that spark
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Well, there ain't no going back
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Ring bell, hard to tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Muttering small talk at the wall
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
He's taught in his school
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
They ask me how I feel
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
How does it feel
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
A-how does it feel
Oh, how does it feel
Then why don't she tell
And if my love is real
How many seas must a white dove sail
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Well, if I die on top of the hill
A girl by the whirlpool
All and all can only fall
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
He's sure got a lot of gall
Ring bar, hard to tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
How many seas must the white dove sail
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
I chased me a woman up the hill
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
"For you cannot relive them
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
But I can hear another drum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
So, one morning when the sun was warm
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Two eyes took the aim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
You better not chew gum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And remain as I am
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Nothing we can call our own
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
A-she takes just like a woman
As they rode him in custody down to the station
But all their daughters put me down
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
She takes just like a woman
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
The foreign sun, it squints upon
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
All lay down their bandanas and complain
But I swear I see my reflection
To my knowledge there's just one man
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
To remember the times when I was your only man
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
But me, I expected it to happen
And the smell of their roses does not remain
That long, black train is pulling on down
From heights that they could not gain
But it's hard to think on
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
She got such a sweet disposition
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Yes, and someone must explain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Please don't let on that you knew me when
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
As you sit on the box you keep him in
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Their religion of the little ten women
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Well, I'm hanging on
But the post office has been stolen
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Have died in battle or in vain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
Why did you trade heaven
He got that fortress on the mountain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
My love, she's like some raven
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
And you ache a-just like a woman
You don't need a weatherman
Advertising signs that con
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Somebody new to beat on
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And all their daughters put me down
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
For the loser now will be later to win
And she aches just like a woman
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Trying to get a lead on
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
You need something to make it known
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
You take just like a woman
The ones that jump on the wagon
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
And she wakes just like a woman
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
And the corner sign
In the pigpen
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
"Not me," said the gambling man
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Out of the shower comes a football man
In ceremonies of the horsemen
That long, black train is pulling down
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Poor boy in a red-hot town
But the second mom was with the seventh son
How can the life of such a man
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
I'll be waiting at the station
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Yet I swear I see my reflection
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
For the loser now might be later to win
All their daughters put me down
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I figure maybe we're even
Suicide remarks are torn
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Guns and clubs followed him down
Well, you fake just like a woman
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Must meet the dawn
She said that all the railroad men
The next morning she had awoken
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
And there's no exit in any direction
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Darkness at the break of noon
How many roads must a man walk down
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
It's very nice to stay a week or two
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Silvio, I gotta go
Every place I wanna go
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
There's nothing you can say or do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
All I'd like you to do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
All I really wanna do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
The man in the coon-skin cap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
How many times must a man look up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
I walked down there and ended up
Man in the coon-skin cap
What good am I while you softly weep
Aladdin and his lamp
Still I've always kind of missed her
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
The wind howls like a hammer
For I am married to a house carpenter
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
When only you are near
Alone you stand with nobody near
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
I close my eyes and I wonder
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
For all eternity I think I will remember
I don't have to go far
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
You heard me saying a prayer for
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
She took him by his long, yellow hair
All you boys better run for cover
Still I say her love-words over
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
In one I was running and in another
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Who came here from Cuba's door
But morning is clear
I say, "Why you say that for
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
The face of God will appear
At any moment you could go under
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I could feel a whole lot better
So, don't fear if you hear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
And I don't even think about her
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
My ship is in the harbor
When you whispered in my ear
The lover who has just walked out your door
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Never no more do I wonder
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
I'm gonna let you pass
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
In the dimestores and bus-stations
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
And so Patty calls the cops
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
To memorizing politics
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Glide across the lonely years
Six-time losers
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
How many deaths will it take till he knows
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Her window's wide open, African trees
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Six-time users
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
But still remains
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
And, though the masters make the rules
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
With a big bouquet of the roses
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
I'd gladly confess
And I try to harmonize with songs
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
But, though the masters make the rules
Romantic facts of musketeers
Well, the ragman draws circles
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And tells me of her dreams
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
To sharpen the senses
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Don't follow leaders
You been hurt so many times
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Good and bad, I define these terms
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And then complains
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
I was thinking of a series of dreams
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Seven days
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And the poor white remains
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
What good am I if I say foolish things
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Statues made of matchsticks
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Wants eleven dollar bills
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
The cowboy angel rides
At times I think there are no words
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
We living in times when men commit crimes
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
That it's you and no one else that owns
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
And the princess and the prince discuss
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
They whisper in the wings
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And inside it with the people made of molasses
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Mama, you know, awaits the news
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
People on the platforms
Thinking of a series of dreams
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
People carry roses
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I try to tell it like it is
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
True love can make a blade of grass
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
You can fall down on your knees
Don't wear sandals
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
You never turned around to see the frowns
You should be made to wear earphones
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
As friends and other strangers
With a fantastic collection of stamps
He's not selling any alibis
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Now, you must provide some answers
To the cutting of fences
And your father, to your sister he explains
Girl by the whirlpool's
"Not me," said the man whose fists
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
You know that he has no intentions
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
I think that it's best
To hold each other tight
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
Everyone still talks about
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
That might be all that you got
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
They tell me revenge is sweet
With your pockets well protected at last
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
How many years can some people exist
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
But, if the arrow is straight
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
You are there in the flickering light
And the first one now will later be last
Like a corkscrew to my heart
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Yet you know there is no answer fit
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
She seems too far out
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Keep me set apart
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
He really wasn't where it's at
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
The slow one now will later be fast
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
They tell me to be discreet
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
You're gonna get hit
How many years can a mountain exist
And I, in my armor, turning about
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
One more night the moon is shining bright
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Well, I finally started thinking straight
I'm moving after midnight
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
You're hearing my heart beat
Oh, everybody's got to eat
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Keep it in your mind and not forget
He built a fire on Main Street
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
The slowest now will later be fast
It don't take too long to find out
But, then again, there's only one I've met
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Everything is always right
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Wait for the morning light
Talking that the heat put
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Johnny's in the basement
Our Father would not like the way that you act
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
In the precious winds they rot
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Without any doubt
One more night I will wait for the light
Plants in the bed, but
You used to laugh-make fun about
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
I soon get some rest
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And, since my feet are now fast
You used to laugh about
There's some people that
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
I got into the driver's seat
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You don't forget
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
I'm on the pavement
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
In the stillness of the midnight
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
By the way, that's a cute hat
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
So he never thinks straight
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Every new messenger bringing evil report
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
It's just crazy being here with you
To protect you and defend you
I'll remember you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I just might have to come see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To be alone with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
And I tell this truth to you
I can be just like you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
The only one I know
I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
He been living there three years now
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always go to show
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Well, I'd sure like to know
It only goes to show
Don't it always a-go to show
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Sooner or later one of us must know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Down every street there's a window
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
But sooner or later one of us must know
With only you in view
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
So, I'm walking down your highway
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
No, you'll not now or no other day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
If I don't take the chance to try
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
She smiles, walks the other way
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Though I'd never say
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
But I can't deny
How many times must the cannon balls fly
For them that must obey authority
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
We banged the drum slowly
She knocked upon it anyway
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
But you can never steal away
From phony jealousy
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
The same thing I would want today
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
I did not do it harmfully
So they took him to the infirmary
And for His love they took His life away
She puts it to me plain as day
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
My ears hear a symphony
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
And the only tune my guitar could play
Went to the doctor the very next day
But I wish there was something you would do or say
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
And that which you've given me today
I send you all my money
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
For them that think death's honesty
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Maggie says that many say
Don't you tell Henry
So I run down most hurriedly
The Spanish-American War had its day
That I done it the way
And the ladies treat me kindly
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
For them that think death--death's honesty
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
To those condemned to act accordingly
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
My mind weaves a symphony
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Or if you just want some company
He made the bells of freedom ring today
That I was just a puppet in a play
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
And it's up to you to say
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Spouted out that liberty
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Is worth more than I could pay
A cock is crowing far away
Well, I saw it advertised one day
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
