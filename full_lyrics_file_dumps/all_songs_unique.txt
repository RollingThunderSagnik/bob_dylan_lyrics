Oh, no!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Hope I don't find out too much!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Yes, come out your window!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Woo-hoo!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Yippee!
Dignity never been photographed!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
I'm in love with you!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
I wanna be yours!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
They got away!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
It was the mailman!
Alright!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
She's insane!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
So long, New York!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Woo!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Thank you!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
I've got the freight train blues!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
My God, they killed Him!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
Oh, yeah!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Goodnight!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
I ain't different than anyone!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Alright, now!
Oh!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Start over!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Play that guitar now!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Good God!
Looking for my lo and behold!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Them Reds did it!
You must think I'm crazy!
How they ever flood my soul!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Well!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Lordy, Lord!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
He punched me out!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Dance!
Howdy, East Orange!
Take me down to California, baby!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Hootenanny television!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Yeah, man!
I've got a million friends!
I got the freight train blues!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Betty Ross!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
They was all over!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
And it's all for the love of thee."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
You can't blame me at all."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Would kill a little bird like me."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Come flowing down so free?"
I love far better than thee."
It's all for the love of thee."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Have it on Highway 61."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
That you must always first forgive them."
"Is it easy to forget?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Country'll grow."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
You can't blame us at all."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
And keep him good company."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
And says, "Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan."
He said, "Tell me about it."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
And have it on Highway 61."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
I can't find my knees."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And hung on a willow tree."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
I'll endow them onto thee."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
I'll bring back my lady."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Will mourn for your return."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
God said, "On Highway 61."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
I would want again tomorrow."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
We'll both go off together."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
They look as dark as night."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
They look as white as snow."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I didn't see you around."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Where you and I will unite."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
So write to her tenderly."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
We want folksingers here."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
You must know about my debutante."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
And pretend that you never have met."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"That way down Highway 61."
Tangled up in blue."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
But I know what you want."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
You and I'll never know."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
And punched my cigarette."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
"Have you seen dignity?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
I'll apply them all to thee."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Get on your horse and ride away."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
We'll both go home together."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
But we were tangled up in blue."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
And on the highway of regret,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
He's the property of Jesus,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
The path you've endured has been rough,
The night blows cold and rainy,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
If today was not a crooked highway,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
You can run down to the desert,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Strike another match, go start anew,
God knows it's a crime,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
God sees it all unfold,
To protect his white skin,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
To a solid rock,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Not the end, not the end,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
You even make love just like a woman,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
I'll go see them come down my way,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Every head is so dignified,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Look away, you rolling river,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
When all will be well,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
I rambled out of New York town,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Face full of black soot,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Paradise, sacrifice,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Eh, see what you can do,
They took a clean-cut kid,
It's alright,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Trouble,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
God knows it's terrifying,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
It all seemed so well-timed,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Just to know that you are near,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
You have explained every mystery,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Tell me,
They must bust in early May,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Try to be a success,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
God knows there's a river,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
How he died nobody can say,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
They say everything can be replaced,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
A hand set the spark,
And it's like I ain't here,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Going, going, gone,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
The beat is pumping,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Just like I did before,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Resent him to the bone,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
That her father was going to hang,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
I went down where the vultures feed,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
And I'm in the shade,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
I want you so bad,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
To be out on your own,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Mercury, gravity,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
How many a year has passed and gone,
You don't have to feed me,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
And the whole world is on your case,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Laying low,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
That can do what's never been done,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Too noble to neglect,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
I got the worried blues,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Going, going,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
But I've been hanging on,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
When the night comes falling,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Speaking to some French girl,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Watch the river flow,
Tears on the letter that I write,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
God knows it's fragile,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
A complete unknown,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Looking for a new fool,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
God knows it's true,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
There's always someone who understands,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
It's a price I have to pay,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Searching everywhere I know,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I want you,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
In the turning of twilight,
Loyalty, unity,
True love, they've been without it,
If anything is gonna sell,
The wind howls like a hammer,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Read books and repeat quotations,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
My hands didn't touch him none,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
She got great big hind legs,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Got my mind made up,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
And think they're fooling you,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
I got my mind made up,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Like a rolling stone,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Tell me that you love me only,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I got those worried blues,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
One by one they followed the sun,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Over the hills and far away,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Icicles hanging down,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
That five walls cannot hide him,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
And may you stay forever young,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
I'd be sad and blue,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
The one we can see and can feel,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Need a woman all the time,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
You had enough of hatred,
A man with a badge skips by,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Vanished from my hand,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
And, if anybody asks me,
She once was a true love of mine,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, I been gambling so long,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
We take great delight in our own company,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
When there is no more,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
He got that soft, silky skin,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
The man in the trench-coat,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Well, there ain't no going back,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
May be living in another country under another name,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
We'll fly the night away,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Dream about you, baby,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Broken idols, broken heads,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Got me a secret membership card,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Badge out, laid off,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
People carry roses,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
If you throw it all away,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Thinking about the government,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Equality, liberty,
It's too bad he had to go,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
But, to remain as friends,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Of this I can't say very much,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
On this new morning, new morning,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
The light I never knowed,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Ever since I been a child,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
The country doctor rambles,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Six months on the chain gang,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Up and down the block,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Why she did go,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
The sky too is folding over you,
Socialism, hypnotism,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
But ye shall be a-changed,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Out to the windy beach,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Get jailed, jump bail,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
He's not selling any alibis,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
But evidently she don't,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
And to come each time you call,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
You made it there somehow,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
But it ain't him to blame,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
And gathering storms may arise,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
To be––direction home,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
My love, she speaks softly,
Father of loneliness and pain,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
You wanna drown love,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
I went into the city, went into the town,
God knows everything,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
I got no place left to turn,
The angels play on their horns all day,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Oh, singing just for you,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
A man named Martin Luther King,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
With what your fate is going to be,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Oh, Angelina,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
I've been around this whole country,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Well, the way I love that woman,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Now, won't you tell me true,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
They keep it all hid,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Went back home to the yard,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Well, I may just swear,
I been good while I been waiting,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
You were striped, you were plain,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Watered-down love,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
While paupers change possessions,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
I know I can't win,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I just keep pressing on,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Too serious to fool,
Hold me, baby, be near,
A true love of mine,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Pick you up every time you fall,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Ye shall be a-changed,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
You want watered-down love,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
One more night the stars are in sight,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Trust yourself,
I'm gonna let you pass,
And it's only that I'm asking,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
The only son of God Almighty,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Friends with you,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Every nerve is analyzed,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
And also by his feet,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Three angels up above the street,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Using every angle under the sun,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
When she lays upon the grass,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Of ancient history,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Strangers all give me the news,
Carry the New York Times,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
By rivers of blindness,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
That the laws are with him,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
God knows that, when you see it,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
So I got those worries blues,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Don't let her see,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Honey, I will meet you there,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
It was from her ship sailing,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
If I didn't have to guess,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
All you can do is do what you must,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Like a dog on a chain,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Well, I'm so glad,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Don't wear sandals,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Silhouetted by the sea,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
To know how much I really care,
I want my arms around you,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
The joint is jumping,
Don't let her know that you love her,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
That one doctor cannot save him,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Come on, come on, stick together,
Make you spin or do you in,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
She said she would never forget,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Don't tie no bows,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Just don't know what to do,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
It's not aimed at anyone,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Love that's pure no accident,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
I can change, I swear,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
My arms and legs were broken,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
I had so much left to do,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Don't let yourself stumble,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
You got something I want plenty of,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
And not going through any great extreme,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
If not for you,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
The sky too is folding under you,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
How he died nobody could say,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
And forget my pride,
And she aches just like a woman,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
For his age he is wise,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Better jump down a manhole,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
You will be alright, girl,
Looking 'bout the government,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
You say my kisses are not like his,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Want you so bad,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
So glad,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Don't ever try to change me,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Grandpa died last week,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Like you never did before,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Memory, ecstasy,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
I wish tonight were here,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Without a dream in my heart,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Who could they get to carry you,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
I once held her in my arms,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
I can't be good, baby,
This situation can only get rougher,
Without ideals or violence,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Searching high, searching low,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
If you must cling to someone,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Light yourself a candle,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
They tell me every man must fall,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Staying far behind without you,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Seven days,
I think we better talk this over,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
But I'm pressing on,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I bless the day I found you,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
They lowered him down as a king,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Corrina, Corrina,
And she'll be coming forth,
Don't let yourself fall,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Look out, kid,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
She's crying like an evil stone,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
You have given everything to me,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
That must be what it's all about,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
I been riding the midnight train,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
"Come along and take a trip,
Made of silver or of golden,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Each time we meet, love,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And the sooner you come up with them,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
For something that he never done,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
That four ears cannot hear him,
She leave by the other and roam,
Just then the order came to charge,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
She never does me wrong,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Gonna serve somebody,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Tell her not to worry,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
I have no one to meet,
Get back, write Braille,
I'm leaving today,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
For her to arrive,
Four by four, no illusion for,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
You gotta look some other place,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Eh, singing just for you,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I got a bird that whistles,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
For she ain't the same,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Want you,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
With his candle lit into the sun,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Whether you are right or wrong,
To hang and to lynch,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Watch the plain-clothes,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Go away from my window,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Hang around the ink-well,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
How does it feel,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
To keep up his hate,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
To stay closer than any friend,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Well, I can't understand,
It don't matter what you did,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
And your streets are getting empty,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
They say every man need protection,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
And point away from the past,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
To be on your own,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
The night passed away so quickly,
To be so useless and all,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
All them prophets good and gone,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
I can see the turning of the key,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Father of black, father of white,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
They say every man needs protection,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
And, if I see the day,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Forever young, forever young,
They say that every man must fall,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Without a love of my own,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Can't find what I need,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
One summer's day he came passing by,
To strict party-platform ties,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
In love and with kindness,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Father of time and father of dreams,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
And I got the worried blues,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I won't have my nature way,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Ye shall be changed,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
And it ain't me, babe,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Give you my money, honey,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
God knows you've got to weep,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Stone you and say good luck,
Mixing up the medicine,
I tried to reach you, honey,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Under the microscope,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
A dream about you, baby,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
It's like I ain't here,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
In the great unknown,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
By losers, cheaters,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
It's really something,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
And I'm just like that bird,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
My senses have been stripped,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Couldn't even see the floor,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
You could look at it and weep,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
I'd already gone the distance,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Into my own parade,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
It still ain't me, babe,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
And ye shall be a-changed,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
But the bottles are done,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
You're beautiful to me,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
The country music station plays soft,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
One by one they follow the sun,
The wind blowing the snow around,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
And you take just like a woman,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
And, although that we're single and free,
Read books, repeat quotations,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
I can't understand,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Don't let her see where you're going,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Don't let her hear,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Far past the frozen leaves,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
You better chew gum,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Circled by the circus sands,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Speak jealously of them that are free,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
And the point is slick,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
It's rising up above my head,
If'n you don't know by now,
Heart of mine,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Stone you when you are young and able,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
And, though the line is cut,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
See you fly or watch you die,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
To shine in through,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Yesterday's just a memory,
My limbs are shaking,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Human gods aim for their mark,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
I need a shot of love,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
I got a wife and five little children,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Someone to close his heart,
And, if I can save you any time,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
He won't do nothing to you,
I never can go because, you know,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
And you know I could never be your own,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Don't put yourself over the line,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Oh, see what you can do,
Precious father, loving mother,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
But it would not be new,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Precious memories, how they linger,
But he's the property of Jesus,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Well, well, well,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
That fellow who never blushes,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
All the silver, all the gold,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Baby, please stop crying,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Yesterday is just a memory,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Thieving in the alley,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
You got something better,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Well, I gave you all my money,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Father of day, father of night,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
I'm going down the river,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Watching the river flow,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
I've been saved – well, alright,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Like a complete unknown,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
But, if I will save you the time,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I should have left this town this morning,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
My woman's never sitting at home,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
You have given all there is to give,
For the wise men and the fools,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I just can't beg you anymore,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
But I will be back, I will survive,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
They––they show me to the door,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I'm never, never far from home,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
God knows there's a chance,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
The day you quit me, baby,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Simplify you, classify you,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
I been good,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
And come every time you call,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Since you've been gone,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
She'll surely turn to white,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
All the tired horses in the sun,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You've got to serve somebody,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
The winter would hold no spring,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Adiós, mi corazón,
You follow, find yourself at war,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
I just say no thanks,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
And they––they look at me and frown,
I just don't know what to do,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Said I'm pressing on,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
And I'm so glad,
You always responded when I needed your help,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Take the motherless children off the street,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Far away from it all,
She's opened up a happy home,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
May be an actor in a plot,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
I had no one for to go my bail,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Nothing too very scientific,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
You married young just like your ma,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Madams light the candles,
He's young and on fire,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
You'll change your last name, too,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Somewhere down the road some day,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
But I'm saved,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Where I will always be renewed,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I found my world, found my world in you,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
So, never leave me lonely,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Far away in the stormy night,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Just like a rolling stone,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
More people kept a-piling on,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Three by three they're turning the key,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
You broke a heart that loved you,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
The air is getting hotter,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
King of the streets, child of clay,
I threw it all away,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Keep me where you are,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
In his anger and his shame,
I get my sweet reward,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
To be alone with you,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Who among them would try to impress you,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Try hard, get barred,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
But you try with your whole soul,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
He been around the world and back again,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Is looking for a new fool,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
I went into the city, into the town,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Giving back all of what you owe,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
I thank the Lord,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Waiting for the trains,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
But it ain't me, babe,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Father who build the mountain so high,
China doll, alcohol,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
I'm going back to Colorado,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
There she come, now, down my way,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Far away and over the wall,
It was you who came right through,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Ooh, watered-down love,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
"Not I," said the referee,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
God knows how to make it flow,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
May you stay forever young,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Broken switches, broken gates,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Carved next to his name,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
With no direction home,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Silvio, I gotta go,
You can raise up your right hand,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I march in the parade of liberty,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Winter would have no spring,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
You to me were true,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
And, on their promises of paradise,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
And there's two white horses following me,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
To find out if she's talked,
And I––I walk out on my own,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Don't try No Doz,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Stripping away at it all,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
One by one until there were none,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And you make love just like a woman,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
She would have married me,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Never weak, but always strong,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
The train leaves at half past ten,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
When I seen him lose control,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
But, if you want me to,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
People going down to the ground,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I try my best to be just like I am,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
You have given me eyes to see,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
He is centuries old,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
You'll be doing society a favor,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
She said she would always stay,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Don't you tell Henry,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
You and me, we had completeness,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Stone you just like they said they would,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
With his fist in a clinch,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
The haunted, frightened trees,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Joey, Joey,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
All I really wanna do,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Without your sweet love,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
God knows when,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
God don't call it treason,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
I landed up on the downtown side,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Is used, it is plain,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Advertising signs, they con,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
But you're doing it again,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Get born, keep warm,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
And I'm back in the rain,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
In another I witnessed a crime,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
But I would not feel so all alone,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
In the ruins of your balcony,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Thank You, Lord,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Heart of mine, be still,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
We live in a political world,
The Second World War came to an end,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
In the foggy web of destiny,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Serve somebody,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Private reasons, great or small,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
But I know that he don't talk,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
I don't want to meet your kin,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
I'm so glad,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Or have done something wrong,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
To have––be on your own,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Don't follow leaders,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I try my best to be like I am,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Holding his club like he was a king,
No, nothing was delivered,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
God knows it's a struggle,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
And ride a horse along the trail,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Yes, I want you so bad,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
They say every man must need protection,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
In the darkness of my night,
When I was in Missouri,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
But, deep inside my heart,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
First degree and second degree,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Like as not, it's better so,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
God knows it's outta sight,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
I can make it through,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
To gather flowers constantly,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Front door shut, back door too,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
It could even be like a myth,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
I got two white horses following me,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Where the neon madmen climb,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Stay away from the train line,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Don't let me change my heart,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
They say every distance is not near,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Better jump down the manhole,
The Communists was a-coming around,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
May be the head of some big TV network,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
And furnish me with tape,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
I like the cool way you look at me,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Aim well, my little one,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
God don't call it wrong,
I had a dream about you, baby,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
In the hills of mystery,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
The day would surely have to break,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
That fired the gun,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
They don't believe in mercy,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
And played the fife lowly,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Don't matter what you did,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Come all without, come all within,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
The kingdoms of experience,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Wasn't making any great connection,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
It always means so much,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
"Not me," said his manager,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
I'm going out of my mind,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Well, get sick, get well,
Who will promise never to part,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
And give him back the time he's done,
People talk over situations,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Don't let her know,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
You got to serve somebody,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
But you were gambling for support,
Judge and jury took their stand,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
On the stone that remains,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Oh, watered-down love,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
You have given me life to live,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
While riding on a train going west,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Go down to the river, babe,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Automobile coming into style,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
I'd only have to stay,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
In the end,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
My love, she speaks like silence,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
God knows there's a purpose,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Says he's got a bad bill,
My woman needs it every day,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
With the juice running down my leg,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Ain't no going back,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
True love of mine,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Over your senses you have no control,
Keep a clean nose,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I don't care if you analyze me,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
And I don't want to drag you down,
And to come every time you call,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
When God and man will be reconciled,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Nothing was delivered,
Look who's back in town,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
If ever I prove false to you,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
For the politician's gain,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
My dear, sweet friend,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
She'll be coming forth,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
So unknown,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I shall be released,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
With a killer's pride, security,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
If you'd see me this way,
And I got those worried blues,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Going,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Someone to open each and every door,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
But he can't be blamed,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
I'm ready to go anywhere,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Saved,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
By users, cheaters,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
I would not feel so all alone,
Honey, just for you to climb,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
But, if I can save you any time,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
I'll be on my way,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Stand up straight and tall,
As his youth now unfolds,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Is it really any wonder,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
It always has hit me from below,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
From their fates try to resign,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Don't wanna be a bum,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Pressing on,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
In the lonely night,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
As the present now will later be past,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Yet every distance is not near,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
You need something to open up a new door,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Or select you or dissect you,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
People talk of situations,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Go melt back in the night,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Going home,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
It hurts me, too,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Broken lines, broken strings,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
It was a girl I learned it from,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
They say every man must fall,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
As the daylight hours do increase,
You were snow, you were rain,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Don't let me drift too far,
Drifting too far from shore,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Day you quit me, baby,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
In the instant that I preach,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Bring the wife and family,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
You stole her love from me one day,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
But now morning is clear,
Father of night, father of day,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
We've killed each one,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
A million faces at my feet,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
And here I sit so patiently,
Never did feel this way before,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
That you'd have liked me to,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
God knows there's a heaven,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Father of air and father of trees,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I went out last night to take a little round,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Every brain is civilized,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
At the close of the day,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
This world is ruled by violence,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
But something has changed,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Relationships of ownership,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Like some mystery,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
For all intended purposes,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
The night would see me wide awake,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
You need something to open your eyes,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Had no one to go my bail,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
In one the surface was frozen,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
But the time ain't tall,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
If she ain't feeling well,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
To your tambourine in time,
Each one playing a horn,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Bringing me all of your charms,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Precious angel under the sun,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Wintertime in New York town,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
To be without a home,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
And comes to a permanent stop,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Love don't have any place,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
New morning,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
A thousand miles from home,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Where life and death are memorized,
Democracy don't rule the world --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
That's where you belong --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
But I know that I can't move.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Six by six...

And guarded them as they fell.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
I remember her whispering yet.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Have fallen from her curls.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
I don't know.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.

When the night comes falling from the sky.

I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.

She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Baby, two feet from the well.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
"And stay all night with me.
The stores one by one, they're folding.

I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.

All the young men with the young women looking so good.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
And shot it fulla holes.
Headed out for the western skies.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
And you must realize the danger.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
And it is time for me to slide.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.

My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
I only saw what they let me see.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.

All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
Step lightly on the ground.
You left me standing out in the cold.

You gave me a map and a key to your door.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.

On anyone that lives in a vault.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.

She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
To the sin of love's false security.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
For an instant hand touched hand.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.

You can show me a new place to start.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
At the sorority sisters' home.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.

Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
It's just the old American way.
Broken voices on broken phones.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.

But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.

See him at play makes me smile.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.

There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
In the border-towns of despair.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
I just can't beg you anymore.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
It ain't quite the end.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I just go pump on it some.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Kisses she gave him three.
Is what this thing here is for.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Gone as the season she's taken.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
68, but says he's 24.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Behind a man's brain.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
Thought I was a communist.
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
To see what kinda words he could say.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Crying out that he was framed.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
With all these promises you left for me.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
To see that you're madly in love.
Madams light the candles.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Got ice water in my veins.
I want you.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
We all know for sure that it's real.
I needed somebody to talk to.
That Johanna's not here.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
It hurts me, too.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
And relive my dreams.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
Lost time is not found again.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
The place that I started from.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Hope you're ready.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
It runs both cold and deep.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
And she had left him to die in there.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
If you just let me follow you down.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Just remember that death is not the end.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
That just struck me kinda funny.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Never will want for money.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
When my working day's through.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.

He gone north for a while.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.

The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Come over here from over there, girl.
That last night I was with.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
It was a normal day.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
I got a bird that sings.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Know not what the years may hold.

The bridge at midnight trembles.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.

If you throw it all away.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
To which a scoundrel clings.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
She once was a true love of mine.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Crumble into one another.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
That brave and devoted band.
If you won't come out your window.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Who says she knows me well.
I can't fight them anymore.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.

I'm ready when you are, Señor.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Need that woman straight and true.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
But with the country to where you're going.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
Billy, you been running for so long.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.

I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
I'm going where I never been before.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
You can say I didn't give to you.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
She saw her father's body broken.
I'm not the one you need.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Turned on my record player.
Gonna serve somebody.
Drink up your blood like wine.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
I see better days and I do better things.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Nobility, humility.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
In the palace of the Pope.
And left me here facing the wall.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
And I need you, ah.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
And try to avoid the scandals.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
'Steada acting like we never met.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
The words that her lover had said.
As the present now will later be past.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
But I ain't got Corrina.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
I didn't feel so cold then.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Go lightly on the ground.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
I didn't realize how young you were.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Reality has always had too many heads.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
But you break just like a little girl.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
You are on the bottom.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
And the night blows rainy.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Now they say it's the land of money.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Looking for the places only they would know.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
That number eleven was closing.
To kill with no pain.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Go find out something only dead men know.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
My love winks, she does not bother.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Figuring a way to get back home.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
That's the day you die.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
A man named Martin Luther King...
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
The light I never knowed.
Slowly into autumn.
And the pearls are from Japan.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
You're drifting too far from shore.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
It sure is right on a night like this.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Tell me.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Everything is gonna be alright.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Just what he was talking about.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
Honey, baby.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
I hate bears.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Girls like birds fly away.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Under the hedges.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
I finally got a job in New York town.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Remember me to one who lives there.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
While my conscience explodes.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
On the caboose of the train.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Tangled up in blue.
My baby stole my heart from me.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
I can walk anytime around the block.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
The night will soon be gone.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
And laid his life on the line.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
For that's the way I remember her best.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Without a love of my own.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Lay dead beside him there.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Good as I been to you.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Our chances really was a million to one.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
When she's better only time'll tell.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Wasn't any difference to me.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
He ain't-a got no name.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
I once held her in my arms.
God knows...
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
I did not do it knowingly.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Fighting every inch of the way.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Some place so high above the wall.
Come on, honey.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
For she once was a true love of mine.
The whole night through.
Down to New Orleans.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Suffering like a fool.
Last radio is playing.
Sweet lady.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
For the times, they are a-changing.
It would go up against every rule.
I just can't do what I done before.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
I'll only let you down.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
And there's no time to think.
Evidently she won't.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
He's only a pawn in their game.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
She pretends like we never have met.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
In my Cadillac.
Someone's watching over you.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
And all your raging glory.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Yes, tell me.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
At the end of the trail.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
For the saving grace that's over me.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
Where I was born and partly raised.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
That old ship was a-going down.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
And tapestry of rhyme.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
And it never seemed strange.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
If not for you.
And each one I've never seen again.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Everything is gonna be fine.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Leave no stone unturned.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
I can't use it anymore.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
She said she would always stay.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Can't see over to the other side.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Orders from the D.A.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
I couldn't find any.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
And the morning will be breaking.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
And keep away from pranks.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
But simply because it's true.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
Now and forever let it be me.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Looking for a new friend.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
You cast your spell and I went under.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
High society, notoriety.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
And light on your right knee.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Hmm, tell me.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Is just equality in school.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.

But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Just what this song is all about.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
You won't get it for money.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
While the law looks the other way.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Hmm.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Everybody that was hanging out.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
When he played and we didn't dance.
That must be what it's all about.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
All because his face was brown.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
So long, honey babe.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Four by four they turn it some more.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
And the people that confronted him were many.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
You're a big girl now.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Baby, baby...
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Some speak of the future.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
I'd like to know.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
See like me or be like me.
When I'm alone with you.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
People bending broken rules.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
I know you always say that you agree.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Tomorrow will be another day.
He's the neighborhood bully.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Close your eyes, close the door.
I would only let you down.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
I can't see through it anymore.
And crime don't have a face.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Is when I'm alone with you.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
"Get well, get well," said she.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
The National Guard stands around his door.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Unless they're from another world.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
So quickly into autumn.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
68, but says she's 24.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Living down Sonora way.
The same as my father before him.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
I always thought that he was well.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
Leading me, going home.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Good car to drive, after a war.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Patriotism, materialism.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
What some people are gonna do for money.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Watch the parking meters.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
If'n you don't know by now.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Until my dying-day.
I don't even know why we come.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
But mine was a little different, you see.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
People sleeping in broken beds.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
The last radio is playing.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
But you were tangled up in blue.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Magic in a magical land.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
You give something up for everything you gain.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
They found him dead in the street one day.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
But I can't get close to her at all.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
They would not let me be.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Fear to bring children into the world.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
The country doctor rambles.
Mama, you been on my mind.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
Bid farewell forever.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
You can make it too.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
You want a watered-down love.
You're on the bottom.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
In the brightness of my day.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Walking around with no one else.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
My baby took my heart from me.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Blues wrapped around my head.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
What looks like the easy way out.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
They don't make nothing here no more.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
The time and the place that we'd part.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
If you just let me come home with you.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
As if a wedding vow.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Friends with you.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
We were the wrong side.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Baby, baby.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
You may not see me tomorrow.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
That's really and truly an American.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
I will only let you down.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
I find it so difficult to leave.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
A-lord, protect my child.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
Trust yourself.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
Somebody better investigate soon.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Just you and me.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.

Heart of mine.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Honey, I never would have come.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Crying out that he been framed.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Look a-the other way.
I see that stationmaster too.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Blood on your saddle.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Honey, I want you.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Come on, baby...
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
In fond memory appear.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
When you made everybody pay.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
It's just the same as talking to you.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.

She can't find him anywhere.
Lord, protect my child.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
My face you'll never see no more.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.

Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.

Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
All because of the color of his skin.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
To hold me in your arms.
Join the army if you fail.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Oh, Angelina.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
When I paint my masterpiece.
I hope you're ready.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
You break your promise all over the place.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.

Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
Life don't mean a thing.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
And you only got ten.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.

Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
If it just don't make me hurts.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
To anything I might've tried.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
About an old man that never done wrong.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
And pretend that we never have touched.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Means another poor boy is underground.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
And without further notice he asks you how it feels.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
I threw it all away.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a, a bone.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Mortality, reality.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
Take it on down to give me grow.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
And he was a friend of mine.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Put me outta doors.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Take me as I am or let me go.
That set everybody free.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
I'd give anything to be with you.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
There were six thousand people there.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
I got trouble in my mind.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Using ideas as my maps.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
With the golden loom.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
I got nothing left to burn.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
But that's what I am paid to do.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Please quit your low-down ways.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
You have no idea what you do to me.
To reach of your rattling drums.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
I took some comfort there.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
I froze right to the bone.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Man is opposed to fair play:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
His epitaph plain:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Serve somebody:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Till I come into New York town:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Yeah, serve somebody:
But there's one promise, darling:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Make promises by the hour;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
All lies and jest;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
I find complete love;
Some speak of the future;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Crumble into one another;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Had to be held down by big police;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
<i>What?</i>

Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Must everybody bow?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Like a rolling stone?
What good am I?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Baby, what more can I tell?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Across the swooping plain?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Before he can see the sky?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
What would life be?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Can I come home with you?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Gal, where you been so long?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
How many paths did they try and fail?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
And one deserving of affection?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
But am I still dreaming yet?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
The love that a stranger might receive?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Where did you hide your halo?
Can you get back in?
Just like a rolling stone?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
How can I live for You?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Has anybody seen my love?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Oh, where are you tonight?
What else can a poor boy do?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
How much poison did they inhale?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Are you the same person that was here before?
How come you don't send me no regards?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
When he's standing in front of you?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
When did you leave heaven?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Have they missed you?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Before they're forever banned?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Just what in the world has come over you?
How long are we gonna be riding?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
How many more without any reward?
Across the swamp of time?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Does he change the course of rivers?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Is it rolling, Bob?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
What can I do for You?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
How does it feel?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Before you call him a man?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
By golly, what more can I say?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Are you ready?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
So I can know if I'm really real?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Am I ready?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
What's wrong with you this time?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Before he can hear people cry?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Too many people have died?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
How many more can they afford?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Where did you lose your wings?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Why and what's the reason for?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Don't you remember making baby love?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Why would I want to take your life?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Does anyone even try?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
What can I give to You?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Who killed Davey Moore?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Baby, can't you tell?
How could they ever mistake you?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
That too many people have died?
For all these earthly things?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
How could they let you go?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Of everything you see?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
To love and follow His direction?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
How's everything in heaven?
How many compared to yesterday?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
And how does it feel?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Somebody seen him hanging around
All the sweethearts you can hold
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
While some, on principles baptized
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Things would be different the next time we wed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Nothing was delivered
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
We live in a political world
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
And those whom doom and death had spared
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
You try so hard, but you don't understand
I run right home and I went to bed
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
There ain't nothing in this world
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
I still can remember the way that you smiled
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
The changes I was going through can't even be used
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I'll always thank the Lord
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Now, a very great man once said
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
I live in another world
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I thought that it was well-understood
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
It's something you did
I want you, baby, just to understand
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Everything stays down where it's wounded
So I'll make my stand
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
You used to be so amused
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
He was a clean-cut kid
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And then you told me later as I apologized
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
I will not go down under the ground
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
She let go of my hand
You used––be so proud
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
I had to say something to strike him very weird
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
I've been walking around
Then came the warning that was before the flood
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
By no special friend
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
But now something has changed
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Either from the mountains of Madrid
And your trouble is you know it too good
But something has changed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Silvio, silver and gold
Now, whenever I get up and
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
For what you sold that's not been received
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
To see him obviously framed
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
As I stand upon the sand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
How many times can a man turn his head
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
But she ain't gonna find the road
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Many times I've often prayed
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Now you don't seem so proud
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Maybe someday you will understand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Now you don't act so––so proud
And things would be different the next time we wed
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
"Equality". I spoke the word
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Roving gambler, he was very bored
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
And that even the nobles get properly handled
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Just what you had in mind
Its iron claws attached
And into the path you are hurled
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
They took a clean-cut kid
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
So I look like a walking mountain range
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
You cut to the core
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Limited in sex they dare
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
But the dark does die
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
And her silver-studded phantom cause
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
That she's the same one
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Knows there's no success like failure
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Leaving men wholly, totally free
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
If dogs run free, why not me
Remember me to the one who lives there
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
So I remember every face
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
When the rain is blowing in your face
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I'm ready for to fade
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
And I'm just the same as anyone else
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Says it's closing time
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Waiting to find out what price
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
As he rises to fame
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Where I could watch her waltz for free
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And never sat once at the head of the table
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Full of hope and desire
Well, it's all new to me
All I feel is heat and flame
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
How was I to know you'd be the one
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Remember me to one who lives there
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Just what you will say when you get home
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Among the lovely people living free
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Lies that life is black-and-white
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
If dogs run free, why not we
There were times when I was so lonesome
Better stay away from those
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Should I leave them by your gate
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Looking at hands for the lines that were
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Taking care of somebody nice
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
I am homeless, come and take me
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
To give the special one you seek a chance
You say you're looking for someone
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Feel to moan, but unlike before
She been gone
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Everybody's wearing a disguise
To show you something you seen before
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And the Negro's name
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
What's probably got you baffled more
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
"It's only you that he does crave
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
On the rising curve
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Little did I realize
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
And I would send a message
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
You said you'd never compromise
From the Golden Gate Bridge
When the roses fade
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
I rode with him in a taxi once
At dawn my lover comes to me
What good am I then to others and me
Up into some paradise
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
I do declare
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Should I put them by your gate
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
While them that defend what they cannot see
But I can get another one
From the start by the rule
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
I don't even notice she gone
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
She plunged him into well water where
I been wondering all about me
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
A bed that is never mine
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
If dogs run free, then what must be
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
How many ears must one man have
And plenty time for good romance
Mona tried to tell me
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
It'll be with me unto the grave
Just pick anyone
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
It's all new to me
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
When I'm all alone
Breaking hearts up and down the line
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Why wait any longer for the one you love
But it won't be over till they clear his name
You into thinking you're the one
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
I'm sure you're the one to blame
She knows there's no success like failure
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
See the primitive wallflower freeze
He'll see by his grave
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Well, six white horses that you did promise
They say don't come back no more
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
You just pick anyone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
But I feel nothing for their game
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
The man the authorities came to blame
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
So, I called up the operator of time
And you see why it's so unique to be
You're not free to belong to me
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
So up she picked her babies three
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
We see this empty cage now corrode
You know, it's not even safe no more
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
I can survive and I can endure
Hunger pays a heavy price
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
When Reilly's daughter got a message
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
From all the plans they do pursue
The crashing waves roll over me
Though its shadow's metal badge
But I can't say I sympathize
What about that millionaire
And suddenly there appeared before me
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
And I ain't complaining none
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
With all memory and fate
Maybe someday you will look back and see
And that is that one must always flush out his house
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
The cause was there before we came
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
The order is rapidly fading
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
There's nothing in here moving
She rode by night and came by morning
But then a whistle will be blowing
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
For your weary toes to be touching
And there's no telling who that it's naming
'Cause the battle outside raging
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Deceived me into thinking
They're drinking up and walking
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Well, I set my monkey on the log
If I was with her too long
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
The order is a-rapidly fading
I can hear their hearts a-beating
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Where the time and the tempo drag
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
The battle outside raging
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
You left me standing in the doorway crying
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
It's not a bad way to make a living
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I have fallen far beneath
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Look out, the saints are coming through
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Then she told us how times were tough
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Girls' faces formed the forward path
And how I know I'll make it through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
You go north and you go south
But they caught him and they brought him back
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
I wish she'd unlock
Shoot in the back
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
You turn around to take a final peek
Make everything from toy guns that spark
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
The man in me will do nearly any task
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Her voice once and talk
Well, there ain't no going back
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Ring bell, hard to tell
How does it feel
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
A girl by the whirlpool
Oh, how does it feel
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
I chased me a woman up the hill
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
A-how does it feel
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
As the last fire-truck from hell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
All and all can only fall
Then why don't she tell
How many seas must a white dove sail
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Muttering small talk at the wall
He's sure got a lot of gall
He's taught in his school
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
And if my love is real
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Ring bar, hard to tell
How many seas must the white dove sail
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
But among the dead that were left on the hill
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
They ask me how I feel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
So, one morning when the sun was warm
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
But I can hear another drum
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Now, they asked me to read a poem
You better not chew gum
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Two eyes took the aim
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
"For you cannot relive them
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And remain as I am
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
She takes just like a woman
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
She got such a sweet disposition
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
But it's hard to think on
How can the life of such a man
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Have died in battle or in vain
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
And there's no exit in any direction
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Must meet the dawn
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
As you sit on the box you keep him in
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
The ones that jump on the wagon
"Not me," said the gambling man
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
In the pigpen
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
My love, she's like some raven
I don't even care if I ever see her again
And she aches just like a woman
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
The foreign sun, it squints upon
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
I figure maybe we're even
You don't need a weatherman
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Yet I swear I see my reflection
But me, I expected it to happen
And all their daughters put me down
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Darkness at the break of noon
But the post office has been stolen
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But the second mother was with the seventh son
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
To remember the times when I was your only man
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
There was little to say, there was no conversation
For the loser now will be later to win
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Guns and clubs followed him down
But all their daughters put me down
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
To my knowledge there's just one man
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Yes, and someone must explain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
But I swear I see my reflection
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
And you ache a-just like a woman
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Somebody new to beat on
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
As they rode him in custody down to the station
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
All their daughters put me down
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
How many roads must a man walk down
Will not be understood as they're spoken
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I'll be waiting at the station
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
You take just like a woman
And she wakes just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling down
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Why did you trade heaven
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
For the loser now might be later to win
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
And the corner sign
You need something to make it known
The next morning she had awoken
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Out of the shower comes a football man
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Their religion of the little ten women
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Well, you fake just like a woman
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
She said that all the railroad men
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
All lay down their bandanas and complain
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Trying to get a lead on
He got that fortress on the mountain
From heights that they could not gain
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Well, I'm hanging on
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Advertising signs that con
That long, black train is pulling on down
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
A-she takes just like a woman
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Suicide remarks are torn
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Every place I wanna go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
There is a place you go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
All I really wanna do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
There's nothing you can say or do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
All I'd like you to do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Silvio, I gotta go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
How many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
The man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
What good am I while you softly weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Aladdin and his lamp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Man in the coon-skin cap
I walked down there and ended up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
She took him by his long, yellow hair
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
When you whispered in my ear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
So, don't fear if you hear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I say, "Why you say that for
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
For I am married to a house carpenter
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
At any moment you could go under
The lover who has just walked out your door
But morning is clear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Never no more do I wonder
I don't have to go far
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
All you boys better run for cover
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
When only you are near
I could feel a whole lot better
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Who came here from Cuba's door
Alone you stand with nobody near
In one I was running and in another
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I close my eyes and I wonder
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
The face of God will appear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The wind howls like a hammer
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
And I don't even think about her
Still I've always kind of missed her
For all eternity I think I will remember
Still I say her love-words over
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
You heard me saying a prayer for
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
I try to tell it like it is
You know that he has no intentions
Don't follow leaders
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
On the back of the fish truck that loads
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
They whisper in the wings
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
You never turned around to see the frowns
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
He's not selling any alibis
Glide across the lonely years
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
I'd gladly confess
To the cutting of fences
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
But still remains
Mama, you know, awaits the news
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
I'm gonna let you pass
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You can fall down on your knees
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
And inside it with the people made of molasses
What good am I if I say foolish things
How many deaths will it take till he knows
The empty-handed painter from your streets
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
As friends and other strangers
Six-time users
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
True love can make a blade of grass
Girl by the whirlpool's
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Wants eleven dollar bills
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And the poor white remains
To sharpen the senses
And then complains
Her window's wide open, African trees
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Statues made of matchsticks
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
And tells me of her dreams
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
You should be made to wear earphones
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Now, you must provide some answers
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
But, though the masters make the rules
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Good and bad, I define these terms
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And I try to harmonize with songs
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And without further notice asks you how it feels
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Thinking of a series of dreams
"Not me," said the man whose fists
And the princess and the prince discuss
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
To memorizing politics
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
People on the platforms
Well, the ragman draws circles
We living in times when men commit crimes
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Six-time losers
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
And, though the masters make the rules
You been hurt so many times
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
And so Patty calls the cops
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
The cowboy angel rides
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
With a big bouquet of the roses
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Romantic facts of musketeers
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
People carry roses
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Don't wear sandals
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
That it's you and no one else that owns
At times I think there are no words
And your father, to your sister he explains
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Seven days
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
The slow one now will later be fast
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
One more night the moon is shining bright
You are there in the flickering light
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Without any doubt
Our Father would not like the way that you act
I got into the driver's seat
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
There's some people that
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
They tell me to be discreet
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
How many years can a mountain exist
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
One more night I will wait for the light
You don't forget
So he never thinks straight
In the precious winds they rot
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
To hold each other tight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
You're hearing my heart beat
You used to laugh about
Keep it in your mind and not forget
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
How many years can some people exist
I soon get some rest
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Every new messenger bringing evil report
He built a fire on Main Street
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Wait for the morning light
Johnny's in the basement
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
It don't take too long to find out
Oh, everybody's got to eat
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
That might be all that you got
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
With your pockets well protected at last
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Yet you know there is no answer fit
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
And I, in my armor, turning about
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
She seems too far out
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
By the way, that's a cute hat
You used to laugh–make fun about
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And, since my feet are now fast
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Everything is always right
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
He really wasn't where it's at
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
I think that it's best
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Well, I finally started thinking straight
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
You're gonna get hit
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Ain't it hard when you discover that
They tell me revenge is sweet
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
In the stillness of the midnight
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
I'm on the pavement
But, if the arrow is straight
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Like a corkscrew to my heart
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Plants in the bed, but
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
The slowest now will later be fast
Everyone still talks about
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Keep me set apart
Talking that the heat put
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
And the first one now will later be last
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
To be alone with you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
It's just crazy being here with you
To protect you and defend you
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
I can be just like you
I'll remember you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
But sooner or later one of us must know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
It only goes to show
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Don't it always a-go to show
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
With only you in view
Sooner or later one of us must know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Don't it always go to show
Well, I'd sure like to know
The only one I know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
He been living there three years now
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I'd sure like to know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Is worth more than I could pay
Don't you tell Henry
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
For them that think death––death's honesty
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
And I'm leaving every day to run away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Or if you just want some company
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
For them that must obey authority
So they took him to the infirmary
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
She knocked upon it anyway
Though I'd never say
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
We banged the drum slowly
The Spanish-American War had its day
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
No, you'll not now or no other day
That I done it the way
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
I send you all my money
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
A cock is crowing far away
And that which you've given me today
But you can never steal away
My ears hear a symphony
And it's up to you to say
But I can't deny
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Spouted out that liberty
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
She smiles, walks the other way
And for His love they took His life away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Someone to get you flowers constantly
So, I'm walking down your highway
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
My mind weaves a symphony
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Well, I'm walking down the highway
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
But I wish there was something you would do or say
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
From phony jealousy
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
That I was just a puppet in a play
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Maggie says that many say
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
I did not do it harmfully
The same thing I would want today
For them that think death's honesty
And the ladies treat me kindly
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
If I don't take the chance to try
She puts it to me plain as day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
So I run down most hurriedly
Well, I saw it advertised one day
And the only tune my guitar could play
To those condemned to act accordingly
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Went to the doctor the very next day
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Disconnect these cables––
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Hava–na–
I'm sure it was not three –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Indians camp along her border –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Leave all the children home –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
First degree and second degree –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
It can't be this way everywhere –
To know where you are –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Private reasons – great or small –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
We just wanted to see some sweat –
You will not hear a laugh –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Havanagee–luh–
Remember me to one who lives there –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
I a-hope you can hear––
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Hang out the whole next day –
Havana–gee–
How badly they were shocked –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
I hope that you can hear––
As suicide remarks are torn –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Oh, my–
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Ha–va–
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
With notions his canoe was laden –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Turn, turn, turn again –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
I got no idea what I want –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
With no other choice except but for to go –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
That can win what's a-never been won –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
I long to hold you in the night –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
