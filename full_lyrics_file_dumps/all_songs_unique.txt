Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
She's insane!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
She takes just like a woman - yes!

You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!

But come on, baby, I'm your friend!

Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
Good God!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Alright!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
They was all over!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Start over!
Betty Ross!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
They got away!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
I wanna be yours!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Oh!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
Hootenanny television!
I'm in love with you!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
I've got a million friends!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Goodnight!
Yippee!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
I've got the freight train blues!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Thank you!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Oh, yeah!
Them Reds did it!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Play fucking loud!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
My God, they killed Him!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
Take me down to California, baby!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Dance!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Yes, come out your window!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
I got the freight train blues!
He punched me out!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
But I know what you want."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
He said, "Tell me about it."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
I'll endow them onto thee."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
I can't find my knees."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
I'll bring back my lady."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Will mourn for your return."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
And hung on a willow tree."
I'll see her soon, I know."
We want folksingers here."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"Have you seen dignity?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
From across that lonesome ocean."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Tangled up in blue."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
I love far better than thee."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
And punched my cigarette."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
And pretend that you never have met."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
We'll both go home together."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
"I've had too much of your company,"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
And have it on Highway 61."
But we were tangled up in blue."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
You must know about my debutante."
And keep him good company."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Has kindly assisted me home."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Come flowing down so free?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
That you must always first forgive them."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"Is it easy to forget?"
"That way down Highway 61."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
Get on your horse and ride away."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
You can't blame us at all."
God said, "On Highway 61."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
You and I'll never know."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
Have it on Highway 61."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "Don't tell me, let me guess your name,"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
I didn't see you around."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
We'll both go off together."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
They look as dark as night."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
For that reason I will have to stay."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
You can't blame me at all."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Country'll grow."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
So write to her tenderly."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
It's all for the love of thee."
I would want again tomorrow."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
They look as white as snow."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget, now, you are white."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
Where you and I will unite."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
One by one until there were none,
Stone you just like they said they would,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
I had a dream about you, baby,
And, if I see the day,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
They say every man needs protection,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Nothing too very scientific,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
You even make love just like a woman,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
She'll be coming forth,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
God knows there's a river,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Friends with you,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Like a dog on a chain,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Name of Martin Luther King,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Then they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Where he got him a job on a fishing boat docked outside Delacroix,
How does it feel,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
And also by his feet,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Stripping away at it all,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
I'm going down the river,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
If your time to you is worth saving,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
You better chew gum,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
If she ain't feeling well,
Why she did go,
At ships with tattooed sails,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Broken switches, broken gates,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
I ain't looking to block you up,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Speaking to some French girl,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
They say every distance is not near,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Going,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
This situation can only get rougher,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Don't you tell Henry,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Alfred Bello laid this rap on the cops,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Got me a secret membership card,
They say every man must fall,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
They run a brick and tile company,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Into my own parade,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
If I didn't have to guess,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
In a pine box for all eternity,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Heart of mine, be still,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I fell down to my bended knees,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
You had enough of hatred,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
They say every man must need protection,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
But all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Come all without, come all within,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Something about you that I can't shake,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Don't let her hear,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Under the microscope,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
I march in the parade of liberty,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
And when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
I had so much left to do,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
That fellow who never blushes,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
You follow, find yourself at war,
You can run down to the desert,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
With no direction home,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
I'd already gone the distance,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
They keep it all hid,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
As his youth now unfolds,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
And point away from the past,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Someone to close his hear,
I can't cross the line, you know,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
The joint is jumping,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I threw it all away,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Adios, mi corazon,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Get back, write Braille,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
The country doctor rambles,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
It's really something,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Without your sweet love,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Eh, singing just for you,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
I wish tonight were here,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
The haunted, frightened trees,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Forever young, forever young,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Waiting for the trains,
And every cause that ever I fought,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
All them prophets good and gone,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
I've been in and out of happiness,
So now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Like you never did before,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
You to me were true,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
The only thing I knew how to do was keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
By rivers of blindness,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
She said she would never forget,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Love that's pure no accident,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
In another I witnessed a crime,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
And think they're fooling you,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Who's never weak but always strong,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Don't let me drift too far,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Thinking about the government,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
"Not me," said his manager,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Maybe when we both get sober,
The sky too is folding over you,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I went out last night to take a little round,
I want you,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Every brain is civilized,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Silvio, I gotta go,
The air is getting hotter,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
A true love of mine,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Far away in the stormy night,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
I landed up on the downtown side,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Of ancient history,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Day you quit me, baby,
And I know what you're thinking of,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
I'm pledging my time to you,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
But I will be back, I will survive,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
For her to arrive,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Take the motherless children off the street,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I just say no thanks,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Just then the order came to charge,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
That lover, who just walked out your door,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
You can raise up your right hand,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Let's hear the story of the "Hurricane",
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
She never does me wrong,
Someone to open each and every door,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
We never much thought we could get very old,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Is used, it is plain,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Father of day, father of night,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
She'll surely turn to white,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Relationships of ownership,
And forget my pride,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Somewhere down the road some day,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Six months on the chain gang,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Loyalty, unity,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
I rambled out of New York town,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Far away and over the wall,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
The sky too is folding under you,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost,
Who could they get to carry you,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Need a woman all the time,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
They must bust in early May,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
I can change, I swear,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
A foreign sound to your ear,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Far past the frozen leaves,
All the tired horses in the sun,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
My love, she speaks like silence,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
I'd only have to stay,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
Well, come all without, come all within,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
You could look at it and weep,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
We live and we die, we know not why,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
A thousand miles from home,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
To hang and to lynch,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Ooh, watered-down love,
The one we can see and can feel,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Look who's back in town,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Want you so bad,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Tell me,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
It don't matter what you did,
You stole her love from me one day,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
More people kept a-piling on,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
For all intended purposes,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
God knows it's a struggle,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
But you were gambling for support,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Well, well, well,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
And comes to a permanent stop,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
When he drifted down to LA where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
Watching the river flow,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
All that and more and then some,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
We wanna put his ass in stir,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Oh, singing just for you,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Puffing on a big cigar,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Joey, Joey,
I went down where the vultures feed,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
She said she would always stay,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
To be--direction home,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
But I would not feel so all alone,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Some are mathematicians, some are truck drivers' wives,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
May be an actor in a plot,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Staying far behind without you,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Never weak but always strong,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
People talk of situations,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
And when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
The man there said he loved my sound,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
And make promises by the hours,
Vanished from my hand,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
But, to remain as friends,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
You have given me eyes to see,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You can hear them tires squeal,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
You have given me life to live,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
I went into the red, went into the black,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
When the night comes falling,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
I never can go because, you know,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
You and me, we had completeness,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
For she ain't the same,
Better jump down the manhole,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Now you don't talk so loud,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
And furnish me with tape,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
And not going through any great extreme,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Want you,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
And I'm just like that bird,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
That can do what's a-never been done,
I have no one to meet,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Just remember that death is not the end,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
I can see the turning of the key,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
I got a wife and five little children,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Ain't no going back,
Where I will always be renewed,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
You need something to open up a new door,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Looking for a new fool,
If you must cling to someone,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
No direction home,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
I don't care if you analyze me,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
By users, cheaters,
Precious angel under the sun,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Dust on my face and my cape,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
He's not selling any alibis,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
That you'd have liked me to,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
So unknown,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
A man with a badge skips by,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
It still ain't me, babe,
It's a price I have to pay,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
A million faces at my feet,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
While riding on a train going west,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
And I'm so glad,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Just as long as you stay with me,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
People carry roses,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
The kingdoms of experience,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
To be so useless and all,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Oh, see what you can do,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You don't have to feed me,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Don't let her know,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Four by four, no illusion for,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
You're beautiful to me,
Watered-down love,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
On the stone that remains,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Read books and repeat quotations,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
The beat is pumping,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
You'll be doing society a favor,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Without ideals or violence,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
I got no place left to turn,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
I don't want to meet your kin,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
But, if you want me to,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
To find out if she's talked,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
I want my arms around you,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Don't try No Doz,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
And it's like I ain't here,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Watch the river flow,
And to come every time you call,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
And all of your children start to resent you,
As the present now will later be past,
I had no one for to go my bail,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
You've got to serve somebody,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Looking 'bout the government,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
The country music station plays soft,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
The wind blowing the snow around,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
And it ain't me, babe,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Not the end, not the end,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
As human gods aim for their mark,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
I got the worried blues,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
One summer's day he came passing by,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
To a solid rock,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Go down to the river, babe,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Nothing was delivered,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
God knows there's a purpose,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Most of the time it's well understood,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
I got my mind made up,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
The winter would hold no spring,
Thinking it was a trusty tree,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
And to come each time you call,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Till he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Hmm, I can make it through,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Rubin Carter was a-falsely tried,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Searching high, searching low,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
In the great unknown,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Memory, ecstasy,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
You gotta look some other place,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
In the turning of twilight,
I tried to reach you, honey,
With his fist in a clinch,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Like a rolling stone,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
And you know I could never be your own,
Don't wear sandals,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
He won't do nothing to you,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Who among them would try to impress you,
To stay closer than any friend,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
I can make it through,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Every nerve is analyzed,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I'd be sad and blue,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Poor boy never say die,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Far away from it all,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Human gods aim for their mark,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
I'll be on my way,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Gay as a jewel when first it’s new,
With a killer's pride, security,
To shine in through,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
They don't believe in mercy,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
But he can't be blamed,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
And come every time you call,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
May you stay forever young,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
To be without a home,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
God knows there's a heaven,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And you take just like a woman,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
God knows there's a chance,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
We'll go someplace unknown,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
So I drifted down to New Orleans where I lucky was to be employed,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
It could even be like a myth,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
The night passed away so quickly,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Father of night, father of day,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Newspapermen eating candy,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
The night blows rainy,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
I know I can't win,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
I'm never, never far from home,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
In the image of someone you used to know,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
In love and with kindness,
I once held her in my arms,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
You got to serve somebody,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
For his age he is wise,
But it would not be new,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Yesterday is just a memory,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Seven days,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I went back home, put on my tie,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Aim well, my little one,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
If you'd see me this a-way,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
God knows when,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Alright, I'm so glad,
God don't call it treason,
He had a job in Santa Fe working in an old hotel,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Serve somebody,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
Trust yourself,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
How he died nobody could say,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
To keep up his hate,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
My senses have been stripped,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Using every angle under the sun,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Some speak of the future,
That must be what it's all about,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
There she come, now, down my way,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
But it ain't him to blame,
But you're doing it again,
All I really wanna do,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
The Communists was a-coming around,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Thank You, Lord,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
You were striped, you were plain,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
The day would surely have to break,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
There's always someone who understands,
I've been saved - well, alright,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
When God and man will be reconciled,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
And pretend that we never have touched,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
And the whole world is on your case,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
They--they show me to the door,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
But you try with your whole soul,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Don't know what to do without it,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
God sees it all unfold,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Like as not, it's better so,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
It all seemed so well-timed,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
The cloak-and-dagger dangles,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Or have done something wrong,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
True love, they've been without it,
And played the fife lowly,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Father of air and father of trees,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
You got something better,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I had a job in the Great North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Over the hills and far away,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Their folks, they said their lives together sure was a-gonna be rough,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
While paupers change possessions,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Got my mind made up,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I could have left this town by noon,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Silhouetted by the sea,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Father of time and father of dreams,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
I love you, pretty baby,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Who will promise never to part,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
I try my best to be just like I am,
You got something I want plenty of,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Light yourself a candle,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
And I don't want to drag you down,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
With what your fate is going to be,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
She would have married me,
Well, get sick, get well,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
In one the surface was frozen,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Since you've been gone,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
My arms and legs were broken,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Oh, watered-down love,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
God knows it's fragile,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
It was you who came right through,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
"Not I," said the referee,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
And I'm in the shade,
You will be alright, girl,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Gonna serve somebody,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Broken threads, broken springs,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Give you my money, honey,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
It was from her ship sailing,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Every moon is so sanctified,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Bring the wife and family,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Automobile coming into style,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
But, if I will save you the time,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
You married young just like your ma,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Don't let her know that you love her,
That two healers cannot heal him,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I can't be good, baby,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
It was a girl I learned it from,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Drifting too far from shore,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Just don't know what to do,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Every head is so dignified,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Over your senses you have no control,
They say that every man must fall,
To gather flowers constantly,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
We live in a political world,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
To know how much I really care,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
And the sooner you come up with them,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Out to the windy beach,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
For something that he never done,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
For the wise men and the fools,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
They lowered him down as a king,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
To be on your own,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
One by one they follow the sun,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
All you can do is do what you must,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
And on the highway of regret,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
You were snow, you were rain,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
I can't understand,
Better jump down a manhole,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
One by one they followed the sun,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Ah, get sick, get well,
Can't find what I need,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Is it really any wonder,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
But it ain't me, babe,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Without a dream in my heart,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
But, deep inside my heart,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Going, going, gone,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Says he's got a bad bill,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I need a shot of love,
Give me the wings and I could fly,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
She once was a true love of mine,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
No, nothing was delivered,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
I get my sweet reward,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
The man in the trench-coat,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
A man named Martin Luther King,
I went into the city, into the town,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Give what I got until I got no more,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Oh, Angelina,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Thieving in the alley,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
She's crying like an evil stone,
We've killed each one,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
To strict party-platform ties,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Said I'm pressing on,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Try hard, get barred,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Where life and death are memorized,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
I got two white horses following me,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Precious father, loving mother,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Equality, liberty,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Stay away from the train line,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
And I got the worried blues,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Pick you up every time you fall,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
All day long I hear him shouting loud,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
We got you for that motel job. We were talking to your friend, Bello,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
But I've been hanging on,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
That the laws are with him,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
It hurts me, too,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
He been around the world and back again,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
In his anger and his shame,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Grandpa died last week,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Just like a rolling stone,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
My love winks, she does not bother,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Too serious to fool,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Don't ever try to change me,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
In the foggy web of destiny,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Holding his club like he was a king,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
My dear, sweet friend,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Enter Patty Valentine from the outer hall,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Courage is a thing of the past,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
China doll, alcohol,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
To your tambourine in time,
And the night blows rainy,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Stand up straight and tall,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
My woman needs it every day,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Eh, see what you can do,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
At the close of the day,
Someone who will die for you and more,
You came down on me like white thunder,
Yes, I'm so glad,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Couldn't even see the floor,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
But evidently she don't,
I won't have my nature way,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
I been riding the midnight train,
Carved next to his name,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Try to be a success,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
And, though the line is cut,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Searching everywhere I know,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
And she'll be coming forth,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Pressing on,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
For the politician's gain,
Though they could not produce the gun,
Had no one to go my bail,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
As the daylight hours do increase,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Heart of mine,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
First to come in was the flying moth,
I don't care if you feel like me,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
Mercury, gravity,
First degree and second degree,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
They pass by so silently,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
We'll fly the night away,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Private reasons, great or small,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Badge out, laid off,
You have given all there is to give,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
It's rising up above my head,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Make promises by the hours,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
They tell me every man must fall,
I run right home and I went to bed,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
It's too bad he had to go,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
So I got those worries blues,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
You made it there somehow,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
And your streets are getting empty,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
Mixing up the medicine,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
And the point is slick,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Father of loneliness and pain,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
It always means so much,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
That's the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
And there's two white horses following me,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
But I'm pressing on,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Early one morning the sun was shining, she was lying in bed,
Don't let me change my heart,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Father of cold and father of heat,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
I thank the Lord,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
He had a job in the old North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
If not for you,
In the little church a-this side of tow,
He's the property of Jesus,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
People going down to the ground,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Honey, just for you to climb,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
And when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
On this new morning, new morning,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
That can do what's never been done,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Ye shall be changed,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
To be alone with you,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
You want watered-down love,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Now, love is gentle, love is kind,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
I'm going out of my mind,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Look out, kid,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Hang around the ink-well,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
From their fates try to resign,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Going home,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
I swung on to my old guitar,
And may you stay forever young,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
But, if I can save you any time,
The carpet too is moving under you,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
To be out on your own,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Now, won't you tell me true,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
And I got those worried blues,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Tell me that you love me only,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
If ever I prove false to you,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Of this I can't say very much,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
You'll change your last name, too,
Well, I don't mind dying,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
And she aches just like a woman,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
It's alright,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Winter would have no spring,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
I got a bird that whistles,
People talk over situations,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Laying low,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
And, although that we're single and free,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
In the little church a-this side of town,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Yet every distance is not near,
When all will be well,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Get jailed, jump bail,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
You have given everything to me,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
He is centuries old,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Make promises by the hour,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Like a complete unknown,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
All the silver, all the gold,
I'm leaving today,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
That her father was going to hang,
Don't let yourself fall,
A hand set the spark,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
God don't call it wrong,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Simplify you, classify you,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Don't tie no bows,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Front door shut, back door too,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
In the instant that I preach,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Don't let her see where you're going,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
That foreign sound in your ear,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
To have--be on your own,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
And she makes love just like a woman,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Keep me where you are,
Just to know that you are near,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
She's opened up a happy home,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Love don't have any place,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Up and down the block,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
I been good,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
He's young and on fire,
Advertising signs, they con,
But the bottles are done,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I would not feel so all alone,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
I think we better talk this over,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Without a love of my own,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
See you fly or watch you die,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Went back home to the yard,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Resent him to the bone,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
God knows it's a crime,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
I just keep pressing on,
Three angels up above the street,
Don't let her see,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
And they--they look at me and frown,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
I been good while I been waiting,
I shall be released,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
My limbs are shaking,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
It's like I ain't here,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
God knows it's terrifying,
And, if I can save you any time,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Look away, you rolling river,
Each time we meet, love,
May be living in another country under another name,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
If you'd see me this way,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I'm going back to Colorado,
God knows you ain't pretty,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
The angels play on their horns all day,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
In the lonely night,
Loaded deep as deep can be,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
All my fathers, they've gone down,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
The path you've endured has been rough,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I leaned my back up against an oak,
Here come the story of the "Hurricane",
Ever since I been a child,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
We take great delight in our own company,
Make you spin or do you in,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
But now morning is clear,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
My love, she speaks softly,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Broken lines, broken strings,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
But he never did like it all that much and one day it just a-went to hell,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
A complete unknown,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
When I seen him lose control,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
But I know that he don't talk,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Saved,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
I just don't know what to do,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
But the time ain't tall,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Someone to close his heart,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
God knows you've got to weep,
This world is ruled by violence,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
I try my best to be like I am,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
There's a ship and it sails on the sea,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
You have explained every mystery,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
The day you quit me, baby,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
God knows it's true,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Don't follow leaders,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
If anything is gonna sell,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
So many roads, so much at stake,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
I got those worried blues,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Father of black, father of white,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
So now I'm going back on again, I got to get to them somehow,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Strangers all give me the news,
But I'm saved,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
By losers, cheaters,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Is looking for a new fool,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
When there is no more,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Stone you and say good luck,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Pistol-shots ring out on a barroom night,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
And gathering storms may arise,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
And give him back the time he's done,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
So glad,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
By the night and been to some place new,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
How he died nobody can say,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Crumble into one another,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
I've been around this whole country,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Baby, let me follow you down,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
I found my world, found my world in you,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
So now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Well, I may just swear,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Keep a clean nose,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
If'n you don't know by now,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
God knows how to make it flow,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
In the darkness of my night,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Madams light the candles,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
I bless the day I found you,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Only one thing I did wrong,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
To be one your own,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
I should have left this town this morning,
Hmm, see what you can do,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Circled by the circus sands,
Corrina, Corrina,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Get born, keep warm,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
You need something to open your eyes,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Face full of black soot,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And I'm back in the rain,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Made of silver or of golden,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Icicles hanging down,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
God knows it's outta sight,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
And, if anybody asks me,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
When she lays upon the grass,
New morning,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Yes, and I'll go last,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Dream about you, baby,
Tell her not to worry,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
If you throw it all away,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Yesterday's just a memory,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Beyond here lies nothing,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
They say every man need protection,
Living in the land of Nod,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
I'm so glad,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
I want you so bad,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Each one playing a horn,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Baby, please stop crying,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
She leave by the other and roam,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
The wind howls like a hammer,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
That fired the gun,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Like some mystery,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Go away from my window,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
She got great big hind legs,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
God knows everything,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Wintertime in New York town,
Well, I can't understand,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
The Second World War came to an end,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
My hands didn't touch him none,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Never did feel this way before,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Or select you or dissect you,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
God knows that, when you see it,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
In the hills of mystery,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
With the juice running down my leg,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Trouble,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Well, I'm so glad,
She's the worst you could ever have,
To protect his white skin,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
You wanna drown love,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
The midnight rain follows the train,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Too noble to neglect,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
When I was in Missouri,
Going, going,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
And ride a horse along the trail,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
But something has changed,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
So, never leave me lonely,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
The only son of God Almighty,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Just like I did before,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
And here I sit so patiently,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
They say everything can be replaced,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
The light I never knowed,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Saying over her shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
And you make love just like a woman,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Don't steal, don't lift,
"Come along and take a trip,
Watch the plain-clothes,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
And I--I walk out on my own,
They walk among the stately trees,
As I travel down life's pathway,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
In the end,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Carry the New York Times,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Go melt back in the night,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
A dream about you, baby,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Where the neon madmen climb,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Don't matter what you did,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
True love of mine,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
The night would see me wide awake,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
It always has hit me from below,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
So he drifted down to New Orleans, lucky not to be destroyed,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
The phone's tapped anyway,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
With no other choice except but for to go -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
Ha-va-
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
Havana-gee-
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
You will not hear a laugh -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
Private reasons - great or small -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
How badly they were shocked -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
Oh, my-
Havanagee-luh-
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
Disconnect these cables--
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
I got no idea what I want -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
I long to hold you in the night -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
Democracy don't rule the world --
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
That's where you belong --
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
Whispering your secret emotion -
I hope that you can hear--
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
I'm sure it was not three -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
First degree and second degree -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
Leave all the children home -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
Ten thousand miles or more -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
It can't be this way everywhere -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
As suicide remarks are torn -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
Haven't seen her since that night -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
With notions his canoe was laden -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
Hang out the whole next day -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
That can win what's a-never been won -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
I a-hope you can hear--
Remember me to one who lives there -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
Hava-na-
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
When it's over, I'd just as soon go on my way"--
Indians camp along her border -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Thank--
To know where you are -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
Turn, turn, turn again -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
And say you'll always let it be me.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
But I know that I can't move.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
Her fond face pale with woe.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Neighborhood bully.
This kind of love, I-I'm lovesick.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
I long to reach for you in the night.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
Now they say it's the land of money.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Know not what the years may hold.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
I hope I'm ready.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
Rain would gather, too.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Lost time is not found again.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Funny way to start a picnic.
She can't find him anywhere.
You sound like a hillbilly.
I want everybody to be free.
You left me standing out in the cold.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
That I really did try to get close to you.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
To the sin of love's false security.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
I once held her in my arms.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
You're a big girl all the way.
Thank you.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
I would only let you down.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
You're the only love I've ever known.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Fighting every inch of the way.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
With all these promises you left for me.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
The same as my father before him.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
And all your raging glory.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
And I's left alone with three children.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
I don't even know why we come.
Walking around with no one else.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
So today I'll be staying here with you.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
I don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Looking for a new friend.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
And no time to think.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
Behind a man's brain.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
His voice was low with pain.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
I'd give anything to be with you.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
And I'll rock you too.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Wasn't any difference to me.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
I hear them semis rolling too.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
On this new morning with you.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a-a diamond as big as your shoe.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
You got it, baby.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Baby, baby...
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Trouble...
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
And crime don't have a face.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
You won't get it for money.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
It's just the old American way.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Crying out that he been framed.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Everything is broken.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
Magic in a magical land.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
After losing every battle.
Thanks.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Living down Sonora way.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
New morning.
That old ship was a-going down.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
I just go pump on it some.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
Havanageeluh.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
But you break just like a little girl.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Well, I'm just thumping.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.

The man you were loving could never get clean.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Tried to create a next world war.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.

Either one of us could do what we do best.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
When she's better only time'll tell.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.

Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.

Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
By the saving grace that's over me.

Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.

I just can't fight 'em anymore.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
And light on your right knee.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.

Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Nothing but the moon and stars.

He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
And I need you, yeah.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
She once was a true love of mine.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
To see what kinda words he could say.
But these to tell what's true.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
The next day could be your last.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
I want you.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here-it's, uh-have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd-I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".
Must be and that is all.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.

But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
It's just the same as talking to you.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
Then the mailman comes in - even he's gotta take a side.
Blood on your saddle.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
May you stay forever young.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Your voice was all that I heard.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Honey, I want you.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Father of love and father of rain.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Blues wrapped around my head.
I's looking around just to see myself.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
My face you'll never see no more.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
And guarded them as they fell.
Buildings going up to the sky.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
You to me were the best.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
In the palace of the Pope.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Ever since I seen you there.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
It was you who understood.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
You cast your spell and I went under.
I'd be lost if not for you.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
They both rode off together.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Four by four they turn it some more.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
All my connections too.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Last radio is playing.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Watch the parking meters.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Everybody must get stoned.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Just to take somebody's money away.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
In the pale moonlight.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Orders from the D.A.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
In the border-towns of despair.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
With my suitcase in my hand.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
Baby, please come home.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Got ice water in my veins.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
And then unto eternity.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
He ain't-a got no name.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
I'm falling in love with you.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
I once loved a woman - a child, I am told.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
I got nothing to go back to now.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
People sleeping in broken beds.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
Throw my ticket in the wind.
But with the country to where you're going.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
The place that I started from.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Is gonna be against the law.
If you just let me come home with you.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Turned on my record player.
Bid farewell forever.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Is just equality in school.
You got a heart of stone.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
I hope you're ready.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
But the fighter still remains.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I-I love her just the same.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
You can show me a new place to start.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Never been so easy or so slow.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
I'm younger than that now.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
He and Arthur Dexter Bradley went a-prowling around.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I--but I just don't know how.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Hmm, tell me.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
He's got his mother's eyes.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
He gone north for a while.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
When my working day's through.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
Mama, you been on my mind.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
You'll never see me frown.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Oh, Angelina.
Got my mind made up.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
You're bound to fall" - you thought they were all kidding you.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
You give something up for everything you gain.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Friends with you.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.

And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.

Love my Blackjack Davey.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
I know you always say that you agree.
Fear to bring children into the world.
And another man named Bello, moving mysteriously.
If I ride back again.
Even the softest touch.

Just like so many times before.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.

It may be some place, baby, you say where.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.

For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
You're on the bottom.
Some kinda things you can never kill.

With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Just crying out that he was framed.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you.

So the radio didn't work so well.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
God knows...
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
We may not make it through the night.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Up and down the lonesome town.

Well, the policeman come and he looked around.

Mortality, reality.
To live it you had to explode.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
And one day he came passing by.
You break your promise all over the place.

He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
But the mountains of the past.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.

Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
And ye shall be changed.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
You don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
And ye shall be a-changed.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.

Down to New Orleans.

Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
You're a big girl now.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Even before you came in the door.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
Gone as the season she's taken.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
I'll remember you.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
For that's the way I remember her best.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Dollar a day's worth.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
My baby stole my heart from me.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Alright, thank you.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
I only saw what they let me see.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
And shot it fulla holes.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
I need a shot of love.
Is when I'm alone with you.
And there's a slow--there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Got to have done some evil deed.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
I'm gonna get my coat - I feel the breath of a storm.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
You were always so close and still within reach.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
Yeah, here's one for ya.
To reach of your rattling drums.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Everything is gonna be alright.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
And they gotta cut something.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
If it just don't make me hurts.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
But no charge held against him could they prove.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
And you only got ten.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
And I want you to be that woman.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
It always does when you're with me.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
You have no idea what you do to me.
I can't see through it anymore.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
It can't be this way everywhere.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
That set everybody free.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Humility, simplicity.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
And discovered her invisible self.
My mind is breaking.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
Carry for you deep down inside.
I got a bird that sings.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Take it on down to give me grow.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
To anything I mighta tried.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
And the morning will be breaking.
Trust yourself.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
Try to avoid the scandals.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
For there's a slow--said there's a slow, slow train coming.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
I followed the winding stream.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
While I'm in the hall.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
And clouds cover up the ground.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
For she once was a true love of mine.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
But I would never do you wrong.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Don't have to look no further - you're the soul of many things.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
That keep us so tightly bound.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
Than people who are most content.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Honey, come and see about me.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
And get something quick to eat.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Reality has always had too many heads.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
I'm a poet, I know it.
Thought I was a communist.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Of every man who put me here.
Don't remember one thing more.
But it was more than I could do.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
And left me here facing the wall.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
His enemies say he's on their land.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
So quickly into autumn.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
But you're never sure why you're here.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
Some place so high above the wall.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
If you won't come out your window.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Oh, her darling love she found.
And fades away like some morning dew.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.

Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Put me outta doors.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
If you just let me follow you down.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Rode slowly back again.

In the dark land of the sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl - and me - oh, God! - I'm a one.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.

They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.

I know something is changed.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.

My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
That last night I was with.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
And she had left him to die in there.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Epitome, rigidity.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.

And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
And both shall row, my love and I.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
At not getting their money's worth.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
Went into the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Leading me, going home.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
It only brings me sorrow.

Rain would gather too.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.

Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
A foreign sound to your ear.

If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Just what this song is all about.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.

Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.

Mine alone.

Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.

I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.

Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.

Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
So many people I never saw in my life.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
And I've never been too impressed.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
She's in some foreign land.

They found him dead in the street one day.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.

No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
Good car to drive, after a war.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.

A man who swears he's not to blame.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
I remember her whispering yet.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.

So, darling, you better come through.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Girls like birds fly away.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Just like you've always smiled before.

Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
That big, old boat started to sink.
An innocent man in a living hell.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
They seem determined to go all the way.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.

I see that stationmaster too.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
My heart is telling me I love you still.

They put me on a train and they sent me back.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.

I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
But you can't see in and I--it's hard looking out.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.

Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
You have slayed me, you have made me.

I fought it full without regret or shame.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.

The hour that the ship comes in.
All because of the color of his skin.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
In the brightness of my day.
I did not do it knowingly.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
And I was brought up by my brother.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And that failure's no success at all.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
You want a watered-down love.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
The night will soon be gone.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
I know they're not what they seem.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.

To see that you're madly in love.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
You can say I didn't give to you.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Yes, tell me.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Going, going, gone.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Come on, honey.
Broken voices on broken phones.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
But I ain't got Corrina.

I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
The water is wide and I can’t cross over.
All because his face was brown.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Now and forever let it be me.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.

Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
I'll only let you down.
To kill with no pain.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Far down the street we stray.

Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Come on, baby...
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.

I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Ever since I seen her smile.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
He could die happily ever after.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.

On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
You're gonna need my help someday.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
I just can't see through it anymore.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.

Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.

I am only human, but you are so divine.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Just like my own false love to me.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
To keep her from the howling winds.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
I couldn't find any.
I'm just average, common too.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Sound like it's on a final run.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
See like me or be like me.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
Everything inside is made of stone.
That linger in the fireball heat.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
And relive my dreams.
And time is beginning to crawl.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
I had something to protect.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
I didn't feel so cold then.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
But I never yet found Fennario.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley - that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this-this is a song-this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
Without this love that we call ours.
Close your eyes, close the door.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Baby, two feet from the well.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
I'll hold it down for you.
Someone's watching over you.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
That's the way I remember her best.
To the old folks' home and the college.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
And neither have I wings to fly.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
But I can't get close to her at all.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
For the times, they are a-changing.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
When you made everybody pay.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
Memories of what used to be.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
I got nothing left to burn.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
In the night the price was paid.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Hmm.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
As the present now will later be past.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
But he sure left here in style.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Crying out that he was framed.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Food was flying everywhere - I left without my hat.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
See him at play makes me smile.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
With the glory that is to be.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
A .44 smokeless under my head.
I shall be released.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
So long, honey babe.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
You only got ten.
She said she would always stay.
That Johanna's not here.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Under the hedges.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
My baby took my heart from me.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
You'll do as much for me.
The words that her lover had said.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
I just can't do what I done before.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
But I ain't neither one.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
If'n you don't know by now.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Chain you down or bring you down.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the--lonely still.
Someone I really could care for.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
I'd like to know.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
That must be what it's all about.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
In this concrete world full of souls.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Hope you're ready.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
A true love of mine.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Unless they're from another world.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
She acts like we never met.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
His mama sure was proud of him.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Sweet lady.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
From the little Minnesota town.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Police at your back.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Hear me singing through these tears.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
And come away with me.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
All the faces we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
If not for you.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
But I was raised on the other.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
And your highway's getting filled.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
There was nobody around.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
I can't use it anymore.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
But not as deep as the love I’m in.
Or define you or confine you.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Slowly into autumn.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
It was a normal day.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
I had so little time to fail.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
And the people that confronted him were many.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
I can't fight them anymore.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
No kindred or relative nigh.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
Please let me ride you home.
Step lightly on the ground.
It don't matter anyhow.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
She pretends like we never have met.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
The whole night through.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Means another poor boy is underground.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Adios, mi corazon.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Alright, thank you very much.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
When my memory is not so short.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
I've made shoes for everyone - even you - while I still go barefoot.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
That's really and truly an American.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
And laid his life on the line.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
"And light on my right knee.
And disregards the rest.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Feel further away than ever before.
With an iron chain around his neck.
It's that million dollar bash.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
I'm going where I never been before.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
And it never seemed strange.
Down along my restless palms.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Well, our captain, he is dead - died for a maid.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
With your golden loom.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
But you were tangled up in blue.
I scarcely feel the glow.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Throw my mattress out there too.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
And watch the parking meters.
Just what he was talking about.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
But simply because it's true.
On the caboose of the train.
With the golden loom.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Drifting too far from shore.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
This song is called "Hurricane". If you got any political pull at all, maybe you can help us get this man outta jail, back onto the streets.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
It would go up against every rule.
Went into a laundry to wash my clothes down.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Where teardrops fall.
It don't matter, anyhow.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Honey, baby.
You are on the bottom.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Hoping you'll come through too.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
What some people are gonna do for money.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I don't believe you.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
To anything I might have tried.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Come on, darling.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Till I come into New York town:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Serve somebody:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Yeah, serve somebody:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
But there's one promise, darling:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Man is opposed to fair play:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
In Paterson, that's the way things go:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
His epitaph plain:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
I find complete love;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Had to be held down by big police;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
About everybody that was hanging out;
So many things that we never will undo;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Everybody that was hanging out;
All lies and jest;
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before he can hear people cry?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Can I come home with you?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Too many people have died?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't you remember making baby love?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How's everything in heaven?
Crime was murder one and guess who testified?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Before you call him a man?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Why and what's the reason for?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
How come you don't send me no regards?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
What?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Across the swamp of time?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
And one deserving of affection?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's chasing after me?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Are you ready?
Just like a rolling stone?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you the same person that was here before?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Has anybody seen my love?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
By golly, what more can I say?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Can you get back in?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
How could they ever mistake you?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Like a rolling stone?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What can I do for You?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
When he's standing in front of you?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Where did you lose your wings?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Oh, where are you tonight?
When did you leave heaven?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
For all these earthly things?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Who you thought you were talking to?
What good am I?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
What would life be?
What can I give to You?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Gal, where you been so long?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
To love and follow His direction?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Before he can see the sky?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Before they're allowed to be free?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
And how does it feel?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
How many more without any reward?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
That too many people have died?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Must everybody bow?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Of everything you see?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
How can I live for You?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Before they're forever banned?
What else can a poor boy do?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Ready, George?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
How can you say he will haunt you?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
How many compared to yesterday?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Baby, can't you tell?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
How many more can they afford?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Did you respect me for what I did?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Don't the brakeman look good, baby, flagging down the Double E?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
How does it feel?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Poor boy, where you been?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Why would I want to take your life?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Don't the moon look good, honey, shining through the trees?
Does anyone even try?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
How much poison did they inhale?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Am I ready?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
What's wrong with you this time?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
How could they let you go?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Across the swooping plain?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Where did you hide your halo?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Have they missed you?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
I've been walking around
She let go of my hand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Its iron claws attached
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
You try so hard, but you don't understand
It's something you did
But love grows old and waxes cold
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And then you told me later as I apologized
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Things would be different the next time we wed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
To see him obviously framed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
I want you, baby, just to understand
Many times I've often prayed
I'll always thank the Lord
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
--Arthur Dexter Bradley and Bello and they both lied
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Standing on the water, casting your bread
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Just what you had in mind
Either from the mountains of Madrid
I will not go down under the ground
He was a clean-cut kid
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
While some, on principles baptized
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
So I'll make my stand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And into the path you are hurled
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
For what you sold that's not been received
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
You used to be so amused
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
There ain't nothing in this world
Now you don't seem so proud
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
And those whom doom and death had spared
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, whenever I get up and
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
I thought that it was well-understood
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
As I stand upon the sand
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Now, a very great man once said
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
You used--be so proud
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
We live in a political world
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And your trouble is you know it too good
He wagged his tail and shook his head
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Maybe someday you will understand
Silvio, silver and gold
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
But now something has changed
I had to say something to strike him very weird
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Nothing was delivered
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
But something has changed
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
But she ain't gonna find the road
I run right home and I went to bed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I live in another world
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Roving gambler, he was very bored
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
All the sweethearts you can hold
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
"Equality". I spoke the word
They took a clean-cut kid
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
How many times can a man turn his head
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Somebody seen him hanging around
And things would be different the next time we wed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Now you don't act so--so proud
By no special friend
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Better stay away from those
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Hunger pays a heavy price
Just pick anyone
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Among the lovely people living free
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
I do declare
Remember me to one who lives there
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
I'm ready for to fade
Knows there's no success like failure
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
When the roses fade
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
And the Negro's name
I don't even notice she gone
I'm sure you're the one to blame
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
On the rising curve
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
It's getting dark, too dark to see
But I can get another one
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
He'll see by his grave
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
So up she picked her babies three
From all the plans they do pursue
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Breaking hearts up and down the line
But the dark does die
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
You know, it's not even safe no more
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
But I feel nothing for their game
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
And never sat once at the head of the table
The cause was there before we came
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
"It's only you that he does crave
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
A girl who would murder her own, true love
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
You said you'd never compromise
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
From the Golden Gate Bridge
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
I been wondering all about me
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
I am homeless, come and take me
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
With all memory and fate
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
And I ain't complaining none
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Mona tried to tell me
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
But I can't say I sympathize
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
See the primitive wallflower freeze
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Waiting to find out what price
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I can survive and I can endure
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
When I'm all alone
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
It'll be with me unto the grave
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Limited in sex they dare
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
If dogs run free, then what must be
When Reilly's daughter got a message
What you're gonna say when you get home
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Lies that life is black-and-white
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
At dawn my lover comes to me
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
There were times when I was so lonesome
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
She plunged him into well water where
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
To show you something you seen before
"That I might be gone a long, old time
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Remember me to the one who lives there
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Up into some paradise
And you see why it's so unique to be
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
The man the authorities came to blame
While them that defend what they cannot see
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Looking at hands for the lines that were
All I feel is heat and flame
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
You into thinking you're the one
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
How many ears must one man have
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
The crashing waves roll over me
So I look like a walking mountain range
That she's the same one
To give the special one you seek a chance
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
A bed that is never mine
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Leaving men wholly, totally free
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
But it won't be over till they clear his name
If dogs run free, why not me
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
So I remember every face
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Where I could watch her waltz for free
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
And I would send a message
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
You cut to the core
From the start by the rule
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And I'm just the same as anyone else
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
You're not free to belong to me
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
As he rises to fame
And plenty time for good romance
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
And suddenly there appeared before me
What's probably got you baffled more
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Says it's closing time
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Well, it's all new to me
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
When the rain is blowing in your face
Con you into thinking that you're the one
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
They say don't come back no more
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Maybe someday you will look back and see
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
It's all new to me
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
If dogs run free, why not we
Just what you will say when you get home
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
She knows there's no success like failure
Full of hope and desire
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Should I leave them by your gate
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
"Oh, father, you will surely die
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
We see this empty cage now corrode
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Little did I realize
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
You say you're looking for someone
You smiling through the fence at me
Taking care of somebody nice
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
She been gone
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
How was I to know you'd be the one
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Should I put them by your gate
But the first it bent and then it broke
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
What good am I then to others and me
Though its shadow's metal badge
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
So, I called up the operator of time
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
What about that millionaire
You just pick anyone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
I rode with him in a taxi once
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
The battle outside raging
And there's no telling who that it's naming
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
The order is a-rapidly fading
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Beyond here lies nothing
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
What am I saying? What am I knowing
If I was with her too long
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
She rode by night and came by morning
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
For your weary toes to be touching
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Deceived me into thinking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
But then a whistle will be blowing
The order is rapidly fading
It's not a bad way to make a living
They're drinking up and walking
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Where the time and the tempo drag
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
For your weary toes to be a-touching
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
There's nothing in here moving
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
I know that you know that I know that you show something
I can hear their hearts a-beating
You left me standing in the doorway crying
'Cause the battle outside raging
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Look out, the saints are coming through
Then she told us how times were tough
You go north and you go south
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I have fallen far beneath
And how I know I'll make it through
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
I wish she'd unlock
Shoot in the back
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
But they caught him and they brought him back
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
The man in me will do nearly any task
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Well, there ain't no going back
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
You turn around to take a final peek
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Her voice once and talk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
He's sure got a lot of gall
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
A-how does it feel
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Soul to soul our shadows roll
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
A girl by the whirlpool
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Ring bell, hard to tell
How does it feel
All and all can only fall
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Muttering small talk at the wall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Then why don't she tell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
He's taught in his school
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Ring bar, hard to tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Yeah, but if I die on top of the hill
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Well, if I die on top of the hill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
As the last fire-truck from hell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
How many seas must the white dove sail
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Oh, how does it feel
I chased me a woman up the hill
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
And if my love is real
How many seas must a white dove sail
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
They ask me how I feel
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
"For you cannot relive them
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
You better not chew gum
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
But I can hear another drum
Now, they asked me to read a poem
So, one morning when the sun was warm
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Two eyes took the aim
And remain as I am
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
You need something to make it known
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
In the pigpen
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
I figure maybe we're even
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Poor boy in a red-hot town
And all their daughters put me down
"Not me," said the gambling man
He got that fortress on the mountain
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Their religion of the little ten women
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
And she wakes just like a woman
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
But all their daughters put me down
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Well, I'm hanging on
But it's hard to think on
She said that all the railroad men
All their daughters put me down
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Well, you fake just like a woman
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
I'll be waiting at the station
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
My love, she's like some raven
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
As they rode him in custody down to the station
To my knowledge there's just one man
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
The next morning she had awoken
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
For the loser now might be later to win
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
But the second mother was with the seventh son
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
And she aches just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling on down
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
But the post office has been stolen
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
That long, black train is pulling down
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
Must meet the dawn
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
But me, I expected it to happen
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
As you sit on the box you keep him in
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
She takes just like a woman
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And the corner sign
And you ache a-just like a woman
Nothing we can call our own
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Yes, and someone must explain
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Have died in battle or in vain
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
The foreign sun, it squints upon
You don't need a weatherman
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Somebody new to beat on
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
A-she takes just like a woman
From heights that they could not gain
How can the life of such a man
The ones that jump on the wagon
Why did you trade heaven
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
How many roads must a man walk down
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
And there's no exit in any direction
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
You take just like a woman
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Guns and clubs followed him down
She got such a sweet disposition
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Trying to get a lead on
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Advertising signs that con
But I swear I see my reflection
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Out of the shower comes a football man
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
For the loser now will be later to win
Suicide remarks are torn
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Darkness at the break of noon
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
To remember the times when I was your only man
Will not be understood as they're spoken
There was little to say, there was no conversation
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I don't even care if I ever see her again
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
There's nothing you can say or do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
There is a place you go
All I'd like you to do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Silvio, I gotta go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
All I really wanna do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Build me a boat that can carry two
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Every place I wanna go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
The man in the coon-skin cap
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What good am I while you softly weep
Aladdin and his lamp
Man in the coon-skin cap
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
How many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
I walked down there and ended up
Who came here from Cuba's door
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
All you boys better run for cover
For all eternity I think I will remember
I say, "Why you say that for
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Still I say her love-words over
Still I've always kind of missed her
But morning is clear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
I don't have to go far
Alone you stand with nobody near
So, don't fear if you hear
When only you are near
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
And I don't even think about her
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
I could feel a whole lot better
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
I close my eyes and I wonder
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
You heard me saying a prayer for
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The wind howls like a hammer
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
The lover who has just walked out your door
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
When you whispered in my ear
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
In one I was running and in another
The water is wide and I can’t cross over
For I am married to a house carpenter
Never no more do I wonder
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
My ship is in the harbor
At any moment you could go under
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
The face of God will appear
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You can fall down on your knees
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
With a big bouquet of the roses
I'd gladly confess
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
I was thinking of a series of dreams
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Don't follow leaders
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
And without further notice asks you how it feels
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Good and bad, I define these terms
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
And the princess and the prince discuss
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Now, you must provide some answers
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
The empty-handed painter from your streets
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And tells me of her dreams
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
To sharpen the senses
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
At times I think there are no words
The cowboy angel rides
He's not selling any alibis
Don't wear sandals
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And inside it with the people made of molasses
I try to tell it like it is
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Well, the ragman draws circles
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
How many deaths will it take till he knows
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
You been hurt so many times
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And the poor white remains
Wants eleven dollar bills
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Her window's wide open, African trees
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
To the cutting of fences
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
They whisper in the wings
But still remains
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
As friends and other strangers
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
You know that he has no intentions
And so Patty calls the cops
Six-time users
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
We living in times when men commit crimes
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Six-time losers
Glide across the lonely years
That it's you and no one else that owns
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Seven days
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Girl by the whirlpool's
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
What good am I if I say foolish things
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
To memorizing politics
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
And, though the masters make the rules
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Romantic facts of musketeers
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
You should be made to wear earphones
And I try to harmonize with songs
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
People on the platforms
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And your father, to your sister he explains
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
I'm gonna let you pass
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Mama, you know, awaits the news
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
But, though the masters make the rules
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
And then complains
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
Thinking of a series of dreams
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
People carry roses
"Not me," said the man whose fists
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
You never turned around to see the frowns
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Statues made of matchsticks
True love can make a blade of grass
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Every new messenger bringing evil report
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
But, if the arrow is straight
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
I think that it's best
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
It don't take too long to find out
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
I'm moving after midnight
Wait for the morning light
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
You're hearing my heart beat
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
So he never thinks straight
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
And, since my feet are now fast
Ain't it hard when you discover that
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Everyone still talks about
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
You are there in the flickering light
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
In the precious winds they rot
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
I soon get some rest
There's some people that
You don't forget
Keep it in your mind and not forget
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
With your pockets well protected at last
Keep me set apart
And the first one now will later be last
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
How many years can some people exist
He built a fire on Main Street
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Someday, everything is gonna be different
To keep it in your mind and not forget
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
You used to laugh about
Without any doubt
In the stillness of the midnight
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
The slowest now will later be fast
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
We can hold up a toast if we meet
They tell me revenge is sweet
One more night the moon is shining bright
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
That might be all that you got
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
They tell me to be discreet
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Everything is always right
By the way, that's a cute hat
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
He really wasn't where it's at
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
To hold each other tight
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
She seems too far out
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
You're gonna get hit
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Talking that the heat put
You used to laugh-make fun about
I'm on the pavement
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
But, then again, there's only one I've met
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Johnny's in the basement
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Plants in the bed, but
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
The slow one now will later be fast
I got into the driver's seat
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
And I, in my armor, turning about
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
One more night I will wait for the light
How many years can a mountain exist
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
I just might have to come see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To protect you and defend you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I'll remember you
I can be just like you
To be alone with you
And I tell this truth to you
It's just crazy being here with you
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Well, I'd sure like to know
It only goes to show
Ring them bells for the chosen few
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He seen a lot of women but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
I'd sure like to know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
He been living there three years now
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Don't it always go to show
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
The only one I know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
I seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Down every street there's a window
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
But sooner or later one of us must know
Don't it always a-go to show
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
With only you in view
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
She starts to speak, but he walks away
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And the only tune my guitar could play
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
So I run down most hurriedly
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
No, you'll not now or no other day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
And that which you've given me today
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Spouted out that liberty
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
My ears hear a symphony
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
For them that think death--death's honesty
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
How many times must the cannon balls fly
That I done it the way
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Is worth more than I could pay
But you can never steal away
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
The same thing I would want today
And for His love they took His life away
I did not do it harmfully
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
To those condemned to act accordingly
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
I send you all my money
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
The Spanish-American War had its day
She smiles, walks the other way
For them that think death's honesty
So, I'm walking down your highway
A cock is crowing far away
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
We banged the drum slowly
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Though I'd never say
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
And it's up to you to say
Well, I'm walking down the highway
So they took him to the infirmary
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
For them that must obey authority
Well, I saw it advertised one day
That I was just a puppet in a play
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
And the ladies treat me kindly
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
She puts it to me plain as day
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Maggie says that many say
But I can't deny
Or if you just want some company
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
My mind weaves a symphony
She knocked upon it anyway
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
From phony jealousy
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Went to the doctor the very next day
If I don't take the chance to try
Don't you tell Henry
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
He made the bells of freedom ring today
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
