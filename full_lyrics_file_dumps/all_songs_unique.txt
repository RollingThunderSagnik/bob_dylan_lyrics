Get me outta here, my dear man!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!

Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
I ain't different than anyone!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Goodnight!
My God, they killed Him!
Oh, no!

All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!

Yes, come out your window!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!

Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
I've got a million friends!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
He punched me out!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!

Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!

Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Play that guitar now!
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I love far better than thee."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
God said, "On Highway 61."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
And hung on a willow tree."
We'll both go off together."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
It's all for the love of thee."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
So write to her tenderly."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
You and I'll never know."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And keep him good company."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
I'll bring back my lady."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
And have it on Highway 61."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
And it's all for the love of thee."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I can't find my knees."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
"Is it easy to forget?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
I would want again tomorrow."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Have it on Highway 61."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Get on your horse and ride away."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
They look as dark as night."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Has kindly assisted me home."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
But I know what you want."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
But we were tangled up in blue."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
I didn't see you around."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Come flowing down so free?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
We want folksingers here."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Would kill a little bird like me."
They look as white as snow."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Tangled up in blue."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
From across that lonesome ocean."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
And pretend that you never have met."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
Country'll grow."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
And punched my cigarette."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Will mourn for your return."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
We'll both go home together."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"I've had too much of your company,"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
You must know about my debutante."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
I'll endow them onto thee."
I'll apply them all to thee."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
That you must always first forgive them."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
You can't blame us at all."
He said, "Tell me about it."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
You can't blame me at all."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Where you and I will unite."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"That way down Highway 61."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Just as long as you stay with me,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
God knows you've got to weep,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Well, I can't understand,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
God sees it all unfold,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
And gathering storms may arise,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Resent him to the bone,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Get jailed, jump bail,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
I'd only have to stay,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Better jump down a manhole,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Never needed to call you my whore,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
In the turning of twilight,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
You will be alright, girl,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
By losers, cheaters,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
To be out on your own,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Gonna serve somebody,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
But, if I will save you the time,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Don't let her see that you need her,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Looking for a new fool,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
A hand set the spark,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Want you,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Far past the frozen leaves,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
For something that he never done,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
My woman needs it every day,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Each time we meet, love,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
You got to serve somebody,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Got me a secret membership card,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
"Not I," said the referee,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
I went into the city, into the town,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
And may you stay forever young,
You got something I want plenty of,
You got something better,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Yesterday's just a memory,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Hang around the ink-well,
In one the surface was frozen,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
I once held her in my arms,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
This world is ruled by violence,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Waiting for the trains,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
My hands can't feel to grip,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Never weak, but always strong,
The wind blowing the snow around,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
No direction home,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Every head is so dignified,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
But the time ain't tall,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
You have given everything to me,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
They say every man need protection,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Serve somebody,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Heart of mine, go back home,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Don't let her see,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
True love of mine,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
It hurts me, too,
I've been in and out of happiness,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
You need something to open up a new door,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
It still ain't me, babe,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Broken threads, broken springs,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Don't mind the driving rain,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
You better chew gum,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Whether you are right or wrong,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
And the point is slick,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
You had enough of hatred,
Hold me, baby, be near,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Every moon is so sanctified,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
All the silver, all the gold,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Simplify you, classify you,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Who could they get to carry you,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Over the hills and far away,
Badge out, laid off,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
She got great big hind legs,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
I get my sweet reward,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
But it would not be new,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
He got that soft, silky skin,
If you'd see me this way,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Go down to the river, babe,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
God knows everything,
I don't care if you analyze me,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
I'll be on my way,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Wintertime in New York town,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
He is centuries old,
How does it feel,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
All that and more and then some,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
To be alone with you,
Had no one to go my bail,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
She'll be coming forth,
Name of Martin Luther King,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
That you'd have liked me to,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Says he's got a bad bill,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
A million faces at my feet,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Memory, ecstasy,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Four by four, no illusion for,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Read books, repeat quotations,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Like you never did before,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
I got the worried blues,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Said I'm pressing on,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
You want watered-down love,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
To be one your own,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
And I don't want to drag you down,
They say every distance is not near,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
It's alright,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Without a love of my own,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Aim well, my little one,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
I think we better talk this over,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Searching high, searching low,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
When the night comes falling,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
If'n you don't know by now,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Don't let her know,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
But I would not feel so all alone,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I try my best to be just like I am,
When all will be well,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
To protect his white skin,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
A true love of mine,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
And forget my pride,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
If ever I prove false to you,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
A handle hid out in the dark,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Watch the river flow,
If you can't quit your sinning,
It's rising up above my head,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
We've killed each one,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Precious father, loving mother,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
And, if I can save you any time,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Without ideals or violence,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Don't follow leaders,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Mixing up the medicine,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
For his age he is wise,
As the present now will later be past,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
More people kept a-piling on,
I'll go see them come down my way,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
In the foggy web of destiny,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
And it ain't me, babe,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
A man with a badge skips by,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
With no direction home,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
You have given all there is to give,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Don't wear sandals,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I just can't beg you anymore,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
To be without a home,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Grandpa died last week,
Don't let yourself stumble,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
They don't believe in mercy,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
God knows there's a purpose,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Give what I got until I got no more,
To a solid rock,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Get dressed, get blessed,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
A complete unknown,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
You could look at it and weep,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
And I got those worried blues,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
They keep it all hid,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
And it's like I ain't here,
But I've been hanging on,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
All them prophets good and gone,
Well, get sick, get well,
They lowered him down as a king,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
But now morning is clear,
They say that every man must fall,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Equality, liberty,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
The day you quit me, baby,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
May you stay forever young,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
He won't do nothing to you,
Human gods aim for their mark,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
See her in that very tight skirt,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
I went out last night to take a little round,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
To hang and to lynch,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Couldn't even see the floor,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
At ships with tattooed sails,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Looking 'bout the government,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
That her father was going to hang,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Well, the job that you used to have,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
To stay closer than any friend,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Without a dream in my heart,
Up and down the block,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
You even make love just like a woman,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
And your streets are getting empty,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
God knows it's terrifying,
So, never leave me lonely,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
First degree and second degree,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
All you can do is do what you must,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
The beat is pumping,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
There's always someone who understands,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Like as not, it's better so,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
They say every man needs protection,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
While riding on a train going west,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Don't let yourself fall,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
There she come, now, down my way,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
And I got the worried blues,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Light yourself a candle,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
"Come along and take a trip,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
And, on their promises of paradise,
You gotta look some other place,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
But it ain't me, babe,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Father of loneliness and pain,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Where mercy walks the plank,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
And the sooner you come up with them,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Loyalty, unity,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
When there is no more,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
I'm going down the river,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
And to come every time you call,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Far away from it all,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
So glad,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
When I seen him lose control,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
With his candle lit into the sun,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Now you don't talk so loud,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Ye shall be changed,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
To have––be on your own,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
True love, they've been without it,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
For she ain't the same,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
People talk of situations,
I'd be sad and blue,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I got those worried blues,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Puffing on a big cigar,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
That five walls cannot hide him,
For the politician's gain,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
I can change, I swear,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
The Second World War came to an end,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
And the whole world is on your case,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
She said she would never forget,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
And ride a horse along the trail,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Go away from my window,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
In the image of someone you used to know,
I'm going out of my mind,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
And all of your children start to resent you,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Father of day, father of night,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Going, going,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Every brain is civilized,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
My senses have been stripped,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
When she lays upon the grass,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I want my arms around you,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
He's young and on fire,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
In the lonely night,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
But something has changed,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
I had so much left to do,
I been riding the midnight train,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Keep a clean nose,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
The path you've endured has been rough,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
It don't matter what you did,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
And I'm so glad,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Give you my money, honey,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Stay away from the train line,
Ever since I been a child,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Over your senses you have no control,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Don't let me drift too far,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Went back home to the yard,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I'm leaving today,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
When I was in Missouri,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
I went into the red, went into the black,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
I rambled out of New York town,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Circled by the circus sands,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Don't matter what you did,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
I don't wanna fake you out,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
In the instant that I preach,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
And give him back the time he's done,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
But the bottles are done,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
The light I never knowed,
Of ancient history,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
And ye shall be a-changed,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Ye shall be a-changed,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Dream about you, baby,
One by one they follow the sun,
Father of air and father of trees,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Love don't have any place,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
But I know that he don't talk,
Just don't know what to do,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I thank the Lord,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Eh, see what you can do,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
So unknown,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
And played the fife lowly,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Ooh, watered-down love,
And it still ain't me, babe,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
I'd give you the sky high above,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
You wanna drown love,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Far away in the stormy night,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Strangers all give me the news,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
At the close of the day,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Silvio, I gotta go,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
To shine in through,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Something about you that I can't shake,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Oh, see what you can do,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Laying low,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Get back, write Braille,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I just say no thanks,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Just to know that you are near,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
The night would see me wide awake,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
You can run down to the desert,
Well, I may just swear,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
To know how much I really care,
You and me, we had completeness,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Baby, please stop crying,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
I'd already gone the distance,
One more night the stars are in sight,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I just don't know what to do,
Mercury, gravity,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
She once was a true love of mine,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
You stole her love from me one day,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I got a wife and five little children,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
It's really something,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
To be on your own,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
To find out if she's talked,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Winter would have no spring,
God knows it's fragile,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
How he died nobody could say,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Five by five they tried to survive,
People talk over situations,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Saved,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
They must bust in early May,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Pressing on,
I love you, pretty baby,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Need a woman all the time,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Want you so bad,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Don't put yourself over the line,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
And also by his feet,
And to come each time you call,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Makes no difference where she's been,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Like some mystery,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Thinking about the government,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
We live in a political world,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
I been good,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Where I will always be renewed,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Don't you tell Henry,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
They run a brick and tile company,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
I don't want to meet your kin,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
The joint is jumping,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Or have done something wrong,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Front door shut, back door too,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
It was from her ship sailing,
God knows it's true,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Into my own parade,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
They say everything can be replaced,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
First to come in was the flying moth,
And, although that we're single and free,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
In the great unknown,
Everything's a-hers or his,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I got my mind made up,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
And here I sit so patiently,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
And furnish me with tape,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
But I will be back, I will survive,
To gather flowers constantly,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
But evidently she don't,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Relationships of ownership,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
And I know what you're thinking of,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
I wish I a-was a magician,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
You married young just like your ma,
I long to see you in the morning light,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
You need something to open your eyes,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I'm never, never far from home,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I want you so bad,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Bring the wife and family,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
My woman's never sitting at home,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
But I'm pressing on,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Without your sweet love,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
They say every man must fall,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
And not going through any great extreme,
Rabbit running down across the road,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Come all without, come all within,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Using every angle under the sun,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Madams light the candles,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
And I'm in the shade,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
The only son of God Almighty,
The country doctor rambles,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And on the highway of regret,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I went into the city, went into the town,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I like the cool way you look at me,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
And she aches just like a woman,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
When God and man will be reconciled,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Father of cold and father of heat,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
They––they show me to the door,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
My love, she speaks softly,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
He's not selling any alibis,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Stripping away at it all,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
To be so useless and all,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Nothing was delivered,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
You're beautiful to me,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
In the end,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
You've got to serve somebody,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
With the juice running down my leg,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
You have explained every mystery,
It could even be like a myth,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Broken bodies, broken bones,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Don't let her hear,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Or select you or dissect you,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
And I'm back in the rain,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Look who's back in town,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Corrina, Corrina,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
But, it ain't me, babe,
I can see the turning of the key,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Don't ever try to change me,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Who among them would try to impress you,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
He been around the world and back again,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
God knows there's a heaven,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Judge and jury took their stand,
My hands didn't touch him none,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
And I'm just like that bird,
Loneliness, tenderness,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Well, I don't mind dying,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Oh, in somebody's room,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
China doll, alcohol,
Had a dream about you, baby,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
People going down to the ground,
But, deep inside my heart,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Like a dog on a chain,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
It was you who came right through,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Yet every distance is not near,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
I can't understand,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She's opened up a happy home,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
You have given me eyes to see,
Don't let her see where you're going,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
In a pine box for all eternity,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Baby, let me follow you down,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Oh, watered-down love,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
"Not me," said his manager,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Face full of black soot,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
We'll fly the night away,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Is used, it is plain,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Beating for the dead that rise,
That fellow who never blushes,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Too serious to fool,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
It always has hit me from below,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Alright, I'm so glad,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
But, if you want me to,
Well, the way I love that woman,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
God knows it's a struggle,
Stone you when you are young and able,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Silhouetted by the sea,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
And, though the line is cut,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
You have given me life to live,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
That can do what's never been done,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Why she did go,
Speaking to some French girl,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
I need a shot of love,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Love that's pure no accident,
Strike another match, go start anew,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
I have no one to meet,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
God knows how to make it flow,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
The kingdoms of experience,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Going home,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And, if I see the day,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Watered-down love,
She leave by the other and roam,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I can make it through,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
How many times have you heard someone say,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
I wish tonight were here,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
It always means so much,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Forever young, forever young,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Tell me,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
The night passed away so quickly,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
To strict party-platform ties,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
And you make love just like a woman,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
High water rising, rising night and day,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Vanished from my hand,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Can't find what I need,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
That must be what it's all about,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Private reasons, great or small,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
But you're doing it again,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
They're one day older and a dollar short,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
With his fist in a clinch,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Advertising signs, they con,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
This situation can only get rougher,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
The day would surely have to break,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
If you must cling to someone,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
And comes to a permanent stop,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
New morning,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
But, if I can save you any time,
She never does me wrong,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Who will promise never to part,
And come every time you call,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
You were snow, you were rain,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Better jump down the manhole,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Friends with you,
Drifting too far from shore,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
We live and we die, we know not why,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
They walk among the stately trees,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Someone to open each and every door,
You to me were true,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
But I'm saved,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
It's a price I have to pay,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
People carry roses,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Just remember that death is not the end,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
The air is getting hotter,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
My arms and legs were broken,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Far away and over the wall,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Is it really any wonder,
They tell me every man must fall,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Got my mind made up,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
And she'll be coming forth,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Day you quit me, baby,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
The sky too is folding over you,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Oh, singing just for you,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Not the end, not the end,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
For her to arrive,
Stone you and say good luck,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
So many roads, so much at stake,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
God knows there's a river,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Make you spin or do you in,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
In the hills of mystery,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
I just can't do what I've done before,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
This place ain't doing me any good,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
I bless the day I found you,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
The carpet too is moving under you,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Read books and repeat quotations,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
I just keep pressing on,
As human gods aim for their mark,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Trouble,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Carved next to his name,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
And you take just like a woman,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
But, to remain as friends,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
God knows there's a chance,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
She would have married me,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Come on, come on, stick together,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Don't try No Doz,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I been good while I been waiting,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
God knows when,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Heart of mine,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
For the wise men and the fools,
You'll change your last name, too,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Eh, singing just for you,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
In his anger and his shame,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Just like I did before,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
I've been all around the world, boys,
If you throw it all away,
Tell me that you love me only,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
I won't have my nature way,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
A worried man with a worried mind,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Going,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Eh, in somebody's room,
But it ain't him to blame,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
And think they're fooling you,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
King of the streets, child of clay,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
And every cause that ever I fought,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Beyond here lies nothing,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Since you've been gone,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
My dear, sweet friend,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Watching the river flow,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Living in the land of Nod,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Adiós, mi corazón,
The winter would hold no spring,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
You follow, find yourself at war,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Going, going, gone,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
So I got those worries blues,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I should have left this town this morning,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
The country music station plays soft,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You made it there somehow,
Don't tie no bows,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
The sky too is folding under you,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Carry the New York Times,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Trust yourself,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Too noble to neglect,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
I want you,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
The man in the trench-coat,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
I tried to reach you, honey,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You don't have to feed me,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
They pass by so silently,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Go melt back in the night,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And, if anybody asks me,
I can't be good, baby,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Joey, Joey,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Each one playing a horn,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Oh, Angelina,
Where life and death are memorized,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
I can finish this alone, honey,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Just then the order came to charge,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Like a complete unknown,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
One by one they followed the sun,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Thieving in the alley,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Newspapermen eating candy,
As his youth now unfolds,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
But you were gambling for support,
A dream about you, baby,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Nothing too very scientific,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
From their fates try to resign,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
The man there said he loved my sound,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
God knows it's a crime,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Well, there ain't no going back,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
One by one until there were none,
I try my best to be like I am,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
You say my kisses are not like his,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Of this I can't say very much,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
With a killer's pride, security,
You were striped, you were plain,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
God knows that, when you see it,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
By users, cheaters,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Honey, I will meet you there,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Keep me where you are,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Someone to close his heart,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I've been around this whole country,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Fare thee well but for a while,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
May be an actor in a plot,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I got no place left to turn,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
I know I can't win,
Seven days,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
You better duck down the alleyway,
If anything is gonna sell,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
For all intended purposes,
It's like I ain't here,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
God don't call it wrong,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Look away, you rolling river,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
A thousand miles from home,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Hmm, I can make it through,
All I really wanna do,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
She'll surely turn to white,
Precious angel under the sun,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
The night blows cold and rainy,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Poor boy never say die,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
If your time to you is worth saving,
To keep up his hate,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
And point away from the past,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
To your tambourine in time,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Three by three they're turning the key,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Six months on the chain gang,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
And she makes love just like a woman,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Three angels up above the street,
Father who build the mountain so high,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I got a bird that whistles,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
It's not aimed at anyone,
With what your fate is going to be,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
How he died nobody can say,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
And the table's full and overflowed,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Heart of mine, be still,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
To be––direction home,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
But you try with your whole soul,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
We never much thought we could get very old,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Just like a rolling stone,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Broken lines, broken strings,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Made of silver or of golden,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Hmm, see what you can do,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I went down to scrub and rub,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Like a rolling stone,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
The human mind can only stand so much,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
If she ain't feeling well,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
The haunted, frightened trees,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
And they––they look at me and frown,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
I threw it all away,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Well, I'm so glad,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
I'm going back to Colorado,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
We take great delight in our own company,
Automobile coming into style,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
While paupers change possessions,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
But he can't be blamed,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Staying far behind without you,
That they do not respect in any degree,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
May be living in another country under another name,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
If I didn't have to guess,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
My limbs are shaking,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
A foreign sound to your ear,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
I would not feel so all alone,
I shall be released,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Don't let me change my heart,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
By rivers of blindness,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Father of night, father of day,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Some things are too hot to touch,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Try hard, get barred,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Only one thing I did wrong,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Under the microscope,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
That fired the gun,
No, nothing was delivered,
If not for you,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
In love and with kindness,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
God don't call it treason,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
You always responded when I needed your help,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
She said she would always stay,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
He's the property of Jesus,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
God knows it's outta sight,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Try to be a success,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Get born, keep warm,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
On this new morning, new morning,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Well, well, well,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Out to the windy beach,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Don't steal, don't lift,
See you fly or watch you die,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Stand up straight and tall,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
In the darkness of my night,
I never can go because, you know,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
As I travel down life's pathway,
That the laws are with him,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Don't know what to do without it,
Socialism, hypnotism,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I had a dream about you, baby,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Father of black, father of white,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And you know I could never be your own,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
I found my world, found my world in you,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Thank You, Lord,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Ain't no going back,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
You can stick your head in the sand,
You can raise up your right hand,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Went to the station down in the yard,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Searching everywhere I know,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Yesterday is just a memory,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Tell her not to worry,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Icicles hanging down,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
And there's two white horses following me,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Look out, kid,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
They say every man must need protection,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
I'm so glad,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
The one we can see and can feel,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
On the stone that remains,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
It's too bad he had to go,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Never did feel this way before,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
I got two white horses following me,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Is looking for a new fool,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Democracy don't rule the world --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
That's where you belong --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
And they gotta cut something.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Lay your hand upon my head.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Honey, I want you.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
And all your raging glory.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
I froze right to the bone.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Epitome, rigidity.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Feel further away than ever before.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
When I run outta things to investigate.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
The whole world is my throne.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
That last night I was with.
'Steada acting like we never met.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
Living down Sonora way.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Gonna serve somebody.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.

He's got his mother's eyes.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
See like me or be like me.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
To anything I mighta tried.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
So quickly into autumn.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
There's a guy I gotta see.
For as long as love will last.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Tell me.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
At the end of the trail.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
In the summertime when you were with me.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
I remember her whispering yet.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
A-lord, protect my child.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
If I ride back again.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
For the times, they are a-changing.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
You're on the bottom.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
When he played and we didn't dance.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
If you just let me follow you down.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Six by six...
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Come on, baby...
Friends with you.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
And you must realize the danger.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
To know which way the wind blows.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Honey, come and see about me.
Just like you've always smiled before.
And guarded them as they fell.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
You're my baby.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
I can't use it anymore.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
In an oil refinery.
Unless they're from another world.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
"Get well, get well," said she.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
I had so little time to fail.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
And light on your right knee.
Everybody that was hanging out.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Where I was born and partly raised.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
You don't have to worry any more.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
But all I see are dark eyes.
I didn't realize how young you were.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
I only saw what they let me see.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Someone's watching over you.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
You're my honey.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
See him at play makes me smile.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Oh, got my mind made up.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
To kill with no pain.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
To hold me in your arms.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
I will only let you down.
"And light on my right knee.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
And shot it fulla holes.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Heart of mine.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
You're the only love I've ever known.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
With all these promises you left for me.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
But I never yet found Fennario.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
Last radio is playing.

My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
By the jealousy of others around her.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
She murdered mortal he.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Evidently she won't.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
I'd like to know.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Good car to drive, after a war.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
At not getting their money's worth.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
Most of the time.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
I got trouble in my mind.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.

When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
At my window with a broken wing.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.

You just happened to be there, that's all.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
The hour when the ship comes in.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Bring that bottle over here.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
My baby stole my heart from me.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
I can't fire them anymore.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
Adiós, mi corazón.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.

All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.

Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Who says she knows me well.
And then unto eternity.

You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
And I want you to be that woman.
And the Santa Fe.

Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.

Up the steps into the nearest bank.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.

That's the way I remember her best.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Know not what the years may hold.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
That brave and devoted band.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Someone I really could care for.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Oh, Angelina.
That which is not permanent don't last.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.

Fear to bring children into the world.
I can walk anytime around the block.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
And all I see are dark eyes.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.

I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.

On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.

You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.

Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.

Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.

The night will soon be gone.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.

I've seen trouble all my days.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Hoping you'll come through too.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
No kindred or relative nigh.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.

Joking and talking about the world outside.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.

Buy you shoes and clothes.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
A true love of mine.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
In the pale moonlight.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
I know something is changed.
But I can't get close to her at all.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.

That you just did what you're supposed to do.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
For an instant hand touched hand.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
When you go your way and I go mine.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
If you throw it all away.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
You'd better get that in your head.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
When my working day's through.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
You want a watered-down love.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
Tomorrow will be another day.
She acts like we never met.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Soft as music, light as spring.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
On the caboose of the train.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
You cast your spell and I went under.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
Oh, yes, they did.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Crumble into one another.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
But I would never do you wrong.
I'll be your baby tonight.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Going, going, gone.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
Come on, darling.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
I scarcely feel the glow.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
I'll remember you.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
And each one I've never seen again.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Even the softest touch.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
So, darling, you better come through.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Someone who will die for you and more.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
But the mountains of the past.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Yes, tell me.
Calling out that he's been framed.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
She saw her father's body broken.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
I said that.
In the palace of the Pope.
Sweet lady.
You only got ten.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Or define you or confine you.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
And gives it to me for a song.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
What's real and what is not.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
I hate bears.
You to me were the best.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
While evening slips away.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Every link was Jesus's name.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
The last radio is playing.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Must be and that is all.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
I did not do it knowingly.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Is what this thing here is for.
Is just equality in school.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Honey, baby.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Father of love and father of rain.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Thought I was a communist.
So many people I never saw in my life.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Valentines can't buy her.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
And there's no time to think.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
That must be what it's all about.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
In my Cadillac.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
Mama, you are on my mind.
The words that her lover had said.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
You don't want me, give my money back.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Please quit your low-down ways.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Drink up your blood like wine.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
And ye shall be changed.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
I hope I'm ready.
I know you always say that you agree.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Things will be alright by and by.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
But the fighter still remains.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Tangled up in blue.
Baby, baby...
Just crying out that he was framed.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
You know, I loved her just the same.
As if a wedding vow.
High society, notoriety.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
They would not let me be.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
To the sin of love's false security.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
That can win what's never been won.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
About an old man that never done wrong.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
Up and down the lonesome town.
And watch the parking meters.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
That set everybody free.
The light I never knowed.
You'll never see me frown.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
That's the day you die.
Rain would gather, too.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
I'd be lost if not for you.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Going back where we come from.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
I'll hold it down for you.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Ever since we've been apart.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
And I'll go last.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
And then go on home and have my fun.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
I took some comfort there.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Waiting on my burying ground.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
And the sails are spread.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
He could die happily ever after.
She's in some foreign land.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Without a love of my own.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
In this concrete world full of souls.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
And keep away from pranks.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
The same as my father before him.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
It would go up against every rule.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Don't remember one thing more.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
You got a heart of stone.
With the glory that is to be.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
When she's better only time'll tell.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Go find out something only dead men know.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Come on, honey.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
You're gonna need my help someday.
68, but says he's 24.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
You were always so close and still within reach.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
But I ain't got Corrina.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
And the morning will be breaking.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
I never saw the man again.
Remember me to one who lives there.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
I shall be released.
I threw it all away.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Never will want for money.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Somebody better investigate soon.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
I'm not the one you need.
Greenwich Village.
We all know for sure that it's real.
But I know that I can't move.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
But with the country to where you're going.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
You're a big girl all the way.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Hmm, tell me.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Put me outta doors.

But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Leave no stone unturned.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
Everybody's having them dreams.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
When you made everybody pay.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.

What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
He's the neighborhood bully.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Precious memories flood my soul.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
He gone north for a while.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
That's really and truly an American.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.

They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.

Nobody stops to ask why.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
Got to have done some evil deed.
The sooner you can go.
My love, she speaks softly.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
It was you who understood.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
I just can't keep from crying.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.

Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
I had something to protect.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Got ice water in my veins.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Right now I'm having trouble.

Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
With the golden loom.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
That keep us so tightly bound.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.

Moving with a simple twist of fate.

But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
That big, old boat started to sink.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Reality has always had too many heads.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
You give something up for everything you gain.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
When I'm alone with you.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
You left me standing out in the cold.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
And disregards the rest.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Till your error you clearly learn.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Chain you down or be your clown.
You have no idea what you do to me.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Try to avoid the scandals.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
By the saving grace that's over me.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
My baby took my heart from me.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
God knows...
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.

That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
I'm younger than that now.
He ain't-a got no name.
There were six thousand people there.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Using ideas as my maps.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Close your eyes, close the door.
I don't care what in the world you do.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
The National Guard stands around the door.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Lay dead beside him there.
He went down to Oxford Town.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
You can show me a new place to start.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
And she had left him to die in there.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
I always thought that he was well.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
After losing every battle.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
We were the wrong side.
And say you'll always let it be me.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
And I need you, yeah.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Crying out that he was framed.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
All because his face was brown.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Suffering like a fool.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Gal, you're on my mind.
His mama sure was proud of him.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
I want you.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
At the sorority sisters' home.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
The country doctor rambles.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
If not for you.
I know the kinds of things you like.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Serve somebody:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Till I come into New York town:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Man is opposed to fair play:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
But there's one promise, darling:
His epitaph plain:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Make promises by the hour;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
So many things that we never will undo;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
I find complete love;
Crumble into one another;
Some speak of the future;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Had to be held down by big police;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Everybody that was hanging out;
All lies and jest;
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<p>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Poor boy, where you been?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Oh, how could you refuse?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
How's everything in heaven?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
How many more can they afford?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
How many compared to yesterday?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
What can I do for You?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
That too many people have died?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Baby, what more can I tell?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Why would I want to take your life?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
How does it feel?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
How could they ever mistake you?
Must everybody bow?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where did you lose your wings?
When did you leave heaven?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
How much poison did they inhale?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
By golly, what more can I say?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
How many paths did they try and fail?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
The love that a stranger might receive?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Like a rolling stone?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Before it is washed to the sea?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
How many more without any reward?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
What's wrong with you this time?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
To love and follow His direction?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
How could they let you go?
Before he can see the sky?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Does he change the course of rivers?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Have they missed you?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Of everything you see?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Baby, can't you tell?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long are we gonna be riding?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
When he's standing in front of you?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
What else can a poor boy do?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Who's gonna let it roll?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Does anyone even try?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Before they're forever banned?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Across the swamp of time?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Before he can hear people cry?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
What good am I?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Are you the same person that was here before?
What can I give to You?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Before you call him a man?
Has anybody seen my love?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Are you ready?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Oh, where are you tonight?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Can I come home with you?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Too many people have died?
And one deserving of affection?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Gal, where you been so long?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Can you get back in?
How can I live for You?
Where did you hide your halo?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Why and what's the reason for?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
I seen better times, but who has not?
For all these earthly things?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
But am I still dreaming yet?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Am I ready?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
And how does it feel?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Across the swooping plain?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Just like a rolling stone?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
What would life be?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
But now something has changed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Either from the mountains of Madrid
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
And things would be different the next time we wed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
So I'll make my stand
But she ain't gonna find the road
And your trouble is you know it too good
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Silvio, silver and gold
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
I'll always thank the Lord
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Its iron claws attached
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Just what you had in mind
And those whom doom and death had spared
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
While some, on principles baptized
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
It's something you did
There ain't nothing in this world
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
But something has changed
Nothing was delivered
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
I run right home and I went to bed
Things would be different the next time we wed
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Maybe someday you will understand
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
"Equality". I spoke the word
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I want you, baby, just to understand
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I had to say something to strike him very weird
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
All the sweethearts you can hold
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
I still can remember the way that you smiled
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
She let go of my hand
Somebody seen him hanging around
But all that suffering was not to be compared
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now, a very great man once said
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
How many times can a man turn his head
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
For what you sold that's not been received
You used to be so amused
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
And then you told me later as I apologized
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
You try so hard, but you don't understand
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Now, whenever I get up and
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Now you don't seem so proud
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Now you don't act so––so proud
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
You used––be so proud
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
I've been walking around
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
I live in another world
By no special friend
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
He was a clean-cut kid
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
To see him obviously framed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Everything stays down where it's wounded
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
As I stand upon the sand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Roving gambler, he was very bored
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
They took a clean-cut kid
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
I will not go down under the ground
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Many times I've often prayed
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
He wagged his tail and shook his head
We live in a political world
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
I thought that it was well-understood
Standing on the water, casting your bread
And into the path you are hurled
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
She knows there's no success like failure
With all memory and fate
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I'm ready for to fade
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
On the rising curve
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
"That I might be gone a long, old time
If dogs run free, why not we
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
The cause was there before we came
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
How was I to know you'd be the one
Up into some paradise
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Little did I realize
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
So I look like a walking mountain range
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
If dogs run free, why not me
And plenty time for good romance
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Leaving men wholly, totally free
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
And I ain't complaining none
And her silver-studded phantom cause
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
And suddenly there appeared before me
You know, it's not even safe no more
Mona tried to tell me
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Lies that life is black-and-white
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Limited in sex they dare
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
And never sat once at the head of the table
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Says it's closing time
But it won't be over till they clear his name
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
So, I called up the operator of time
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Better stay away from those
So up she picked her babies three
And I'm just the same as anyone else
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
That she's the same one
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Though its shadow's metal badge
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
But the dark does die
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
While them that defend what they cannot see
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
If dogs run free, then what must be
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Should I put them by your gate
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Just what you will say when you get home
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
You could almost think that you're seeing double
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Well, six white horses that you did promise
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
But I can't say I sympathize
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
To give the special one you seek a chance
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
So I remember every face
You smiling through the fence at me
She plunged him into well water where
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Full of hope and desire
At dawn my lover comes to me
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Most of the time I can't even be sure
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Among the lovely people living free
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
I don't even notice she gone
The man the authorities came to blame
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
And I would send a message
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
You cut to the core
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
As he rises to fame
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Why wait any longer for the one you love
I can survive and I can endure
Well, it's all new to me
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
She been gone
I do declare
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
How many ears must one man have
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
They say don't come back no more
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
From all the plans they do pursue
Con you into thinking that you're the one
From the start by the rule
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
I rode with him in a taxi once
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Knows there's no success like failure
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Breaking hearts up and down the line
See the primitive wallflower freeze
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Taking care of somebody nice
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Should I leave them by your gate
And the Negro's name
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
It's all new to me
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
"Oh, father, you will surely die
All I feel is heat and flame
Feel to moan, but unlike before
I am homeless, come and take me
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
I been wondering all about me
To show you something you seen before
But I feel nothing for their game
Waiting to find out what price
When the roses fade
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
What's probably got you baffled more
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
But I can get another one
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
From the Golden Gate Bridge
You just pick anyone
There were times when I was so lonesome
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
You into thinking you're the one
We see this empty cage now corrode
Remember me to one who lives there
And that is that one must always flush out his house
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
You said you'd never compromise
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
When I'm all alone
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
You're not free to belong to me
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
What you're gonna say when you get home
Looking at hands for the lines that were
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
And you see why it's so unique to be
What good am I then to others and me
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
"It's only you that he does crave
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
A bed that is never mine
He'll see by his grave
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
What about that millionaire
The crashing waves roll over me
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Remember me to the one who lives there
It'll be with me unto the grave
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
You say you're looking for someone
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Hunger pays a heavy price
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Just pick anyone
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
When the rain is blowing in your face
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
If I was with her too long
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
What am I saying? What am I knowing
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
For your weary toes to be touching
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
She rode by night and came by morning
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
They're drinking up and walking
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
The order is a-rapidly fading
The battle outside raging
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Deceived me into thinking
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Well, I set my monkey on the log
'Cause the battle outside raging
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
The order is rapidly fading
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
It's not a bad way to make a living
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Early in the morning, early in the morning
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Where the time and the tempo drag
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Beyond here lies nothing
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
But then a whistle will be blowing
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
There's nothing in here moving
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
You left me standing in the doorway crying
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
I know that you know that I know that you show something
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And how I know I'll make it through
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Then she told us how times were tough
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I have fallen far beneath
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
You go north and you go south
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Her voice once and talk
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
I wish she'd unlock
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You turn around to take a final peek
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Make everything from toy guns that spark
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Shoot in the back
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
The man in me will do nearly any task
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Well, there ain't no going back
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Ring bar, hard to tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
How many seas must a white dove sail
A girl by the whirlpool
Soul to soul our shadows roll
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Oh, how does it feel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
He's sure got a lot of gall
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
How many seas must the white dove sail
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
And if my love is real
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Ring bell, hard to tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
He's taught in his school
A-how does it feel
Then why don't she tell
All and all can only fall
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
How does it feel
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
They ask me how I feel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
But I can hear another drum
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
And remain as I am
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
"For you cannot relive them
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
You better not chew gum
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Two eyes took the aim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
A-she takes just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling on down
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Out of the shower comes a football man
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
For the loser now will be later to win
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
She takes just like a woman
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
My love, she's like some raven
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Guns and clubs followed him down
Advertising signs that con
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
To my knowledge there's just one man
But the second mom was with the seventh son
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
That long, black train is pulling down
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
I figure maybe we're even
Yes, and someone must explain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
And there's no exit in any direction
All their daughters put me down
And you ache a-just like a woman
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
And she wakes just like a woman
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
In the pigpen
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
"Not me," said the gambling man
Have died in battle or in vain
I'll be waiting at the station
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
You need something to make it known
But the post office has been stolen
To remember the times when I was your only man
Well, you fake just like a woman
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Nothing we can call our own
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
But me, I expected it to happen
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
How many roads must a man walk down
I don't even care if I ever see her again
How can the life of such a man
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
But all their daughters put me down
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
And the corner sign
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
The next morning she had awoken
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Suicide remarks are torn
Must meet the dawn
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
She said that all the railroad men
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Darkness at the break of noon
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
The ones that jump on the wagon
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And the smell of their roses does not remain
But I swear I see my reflection
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
And she aches just like a woman
Somebody new to beat on
He got that fortress on the mountain
You take just like a woman
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
She got such a sweet disposition
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
You don't need a weatherman
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Will not be understood as they're spoken
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
And all their daughters put me down
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Well, I'm hanging on
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
The foreign sun, it squints upon
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
For the loser now might be later to win
Trying to get a lead on
From heights that they could not gain
But it's hard to think on
Why did you trade heaven
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Their religion of the little ten women
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
All I really wanna do
There's nothing you can say or do
Silvio, I gotta go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
There is a place you go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Every place I wanna go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
All I'd like you to do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Aladdin and his lamp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
What good am I while you softly weep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Man in the coon-skin cap
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
I walked down there and ended up
How many times must a man look up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
In one I was running and in another
I close my eyes and I wonder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
For I am married to a house carpenter
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Still I've always kind of missed her
I don't have to go far
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
The face of God will appear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
She took him by his long, yellow hair
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
For all eternity I think I will remember
All you boys better run for cover
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Who came here from Cuba's door
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
My ship is in the harbor
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
Never no more do I wonder
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
At any moment you could go under
So, don't fear if you hear
You heard me saying a prayer for
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I say, "Why you say that for
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
The lover who has just walked out your door
But morning is clear
And I don't even think about her
When you whispered in my ear
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
I could feel a whole lot better
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
When only you are near
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
The wind howls like a hammer
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Still I say her love-words over
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
You know that he has no intentions
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
At times I think there are no words
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
How many deaths will it take till he knows
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
To sharpen the senses
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
That it's you and no one else that owns
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And tells me of her dreams
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Seven days
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
And the princess and the prince discuss
Six-time losers
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
But still remains
They whisper in the wings
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And inside it with the people made of molasses
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Don't follow leaders
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
With a fantastic collection of stamps
The cowboy angel rides
Glide across the lonely years
Her window's wide open, African trees
Don't wear sandals
You should be made to wear earphones
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I try to tell it like it is
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
With a big bouquet of the roses
In the dimestores and bus-stations
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
To the cutting of fences
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
What good am I if I say foolish things
Wants eleven dollar bills
People on the platforms
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
True love can make a blade of grass
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Well, the ragman draws circles
And, though the masters make the rules
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
And so Patty calls the cops
As friends and other strangers
Statues made of matchsticks
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Girl by the whirlpool's
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
I'd gladly confess
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
I'm gonna let you pass
We living in times when men commit crimes
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
On the back of the fish truck that loads
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
And your father, to your sister he explains
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Romantic facts of musketeers
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Six-time users
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
You never turned around to see the frowns
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
And I try to harmonize with songs
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
And without further notice asks you how it feels
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
He's not selling any alibis
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
But, though the masters make the rules
Good and bad, I define these terms
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And the poor white remains
To memorizing politics
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Thinking of a series of dreams
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Now, you must provide some answers
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
People carry roses
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And then complains
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
You can fall down on your knees
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
"Not me," said the man whose fists
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
You been hurt so many times
She seems too far out
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
He built a fire on Main Street
You don't forget
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Wait for the morning light
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Oh, everybody's got to eat
The slow one now will later be fast
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I think that it's best
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
You're hearing my heart beat
How many years can a mountain exist
And I, in my armor, turning about
They tell me to be discreet
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
How many years can some people exist
With your pockets well protected at last
I'm on the pavement
You're gonna get hit
Our Father would not like the way that you act
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Everything is always right
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Every new messenger bringing evil report
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I got into the driver's seat
It don't take too long to find out
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
But, then again, there's only one I've met
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
There's some people that
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
In the stillness of the midnight
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Yet you know there is no answer fit
But, if the arrow is straight
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
So he never thinks straight
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Johnny's in the basement
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Well, I finally started thinking straight
You are there in the flickering light
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Keep it in your mind and not forget
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Without any doubt
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
By the way, that's a cute hat
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Keep me set apart
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And the first one now will later be last
You used to laugh–make fun about
You used to laugh about
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
One more night I will wait for the light
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
In the precious winds they rot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
To hold each other tight
They tell me revenge is sweet
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Plants in the bed, but
Like a corkscrew to my heart
The slowest now will later be fast
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Talking that the heat put
And, since my feet are now fast
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
One more night the moon is shining bright
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Everyone still talks about
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
I'm moving after midnight
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
That might be all that you got
I soon get some rest
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
He really wasn't where it's at
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I can be just like you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To be alone with you
I just might have to come see you
To protect you and defend you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
And I tell this truth to you
Yes, I'd sure like to know
The only one I know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
It only goes to show
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
But sooner or later one of us must know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Don't it always a-go to show
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
He been living there three years now
Sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Well, I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
I'd sure like to know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Down every street there's a window
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
With only you in view
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Don't it always go to show
My ears hear a symphony
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
So they took him to the infirmary
I send you all my money
Well, I saw it advertised one day
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
My mind weaves a symphony
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
He made the bells of freedom ring today
A cock is crowing far away
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
She starts to speak, but he walks away
If I don't take the chance to try
So, I'm walking down your highway
But I wish there was something you would do or say
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
And the only tune my guitar could play
Though I'd never say
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
So I run down most hurriedly
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
She knocked upon it anyway
But you can never steal away
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
That I done it the way
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
The Spanish-American War had its day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Maggie says that many say
She smiles, walks the other way
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
But I can't deny
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
I did not do it harmfully
Is worth more than I could pay
And for His love they took His life away
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Or if you just want some company
No, you'll not now or no other day
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
She puts it to me plain as day
The same thing I would want today
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
For them that think death––death's honesty
We banged the drum slowly
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
From phony jealousy
Spouted out that liberty
For them that must obey authority
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
That I was just a puppet in a play
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
To those condemned to act accordingly
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Went to the doctor the very next day
And the ladies treat me kindly
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
And it's up to you to say
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Someone to get you flowers constantly
And I'm leaving every day to run away
For them that think death's honesty
Don't you tell Henry
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
How many times must the cannon balls fly
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
And that which you've given me today
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Havanagee–luh–
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
That can win what's a-never been won –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
You will not hear a laugh –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Remember me to one who lives there –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Private reasons – great or small –
I a-hope you can hear––
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
With notions his canoe was laden –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Ha–va–
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
I got no idea what I want –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
It can't be this way everywhere –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Oh, my–
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Hava–na–
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Whispering your secret emotion –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Disconnect these cables––
With no other choice except but for to go –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Leave all the children home –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
I'm sure it was not three –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Havana–gee–
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Hang out the whole next day –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
To know where you are –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Though its glow is waxed in black –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Ten thousand miles or more –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Indians camp along her border –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
I long to hold you in the night –
As suicide remarks are torn –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
First degree and second degree –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
I hope that you can hear––
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Haven't seen her since that night –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
How badly they were shocked –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
