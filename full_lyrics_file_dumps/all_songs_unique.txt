She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!

I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
We'll both go home together."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
But I know what you want."
It's all for the love of thee."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
I can't find my knees."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
I didn't see you around."
So write to her tenderly."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
We'll both go off together."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
I'll see her soon, I know."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
I love far better than thee."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
For that reason I will have to stay."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"Is it easy to forget?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
And it's all for the love of thee."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
I'll bring back my lady."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Have it on Highway 61."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
You can't blame us at all."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I'll endow them onto thee."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Country'll grow."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
That you must always first forgive them."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
And have it on Highway 61."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Where you and I will unite."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
They look as white as snow."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
And pretend that you never have met."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
And hung on a willow tree."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Come flowing down so free?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I would want again tomorrow."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Tangled up in blue."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
From across that lonesome ocean."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Has kindly assisted me home."
And keep him good company."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
You can't blame me at all."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
"That way down Highway 61."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Get on your horse and ride away."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
They look as dark as night."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Will mourn for your return."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
But we were tangled up in blue."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
You must know about my debutante."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
You and I'll never know."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
And punched my cigarette."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
God said, "On Highway 61."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Would kill a little bird like me."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
We want folksingers here."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Don't wear sandals,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
But we never did too much talking anyway,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Made before the foundation of the world,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
My senses have been stripped,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
I can't understand,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
In the ruins of your balcony,
You stole her love from me one day,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
You had enough of hatred,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
And there's two white horses following me,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Oh, singing just for you,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Over your senses you have no control,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
So I got those worries blues,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
It's really something,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
To strict party-platform ties,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
How many times have you heard someone say,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
To have––be on your own,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
I went into the red, went into the black,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
They say every distance is not near,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
I been good while I been waiting,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I had a dream about you, baby,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
I'll be on my way,
Searching everywhere I know,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Without your sweet love,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
It all seemed so well-timed,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
You will be alright, girl,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Give what I got until I got no more,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
"Not I," said the referee,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Far past the frozen leaves,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
In the little church a-this side of town,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
God knows there's a purpose,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Trouble,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
But he can't be blamed,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
How he died nobody can say,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Want you,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Far away and over the wall,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
They say every man must fall,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Every brain is civilized,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Equality, liberty,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Says he's got a bad bill,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I once held her in my arms,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
To be––direction home,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
As I travel down life's pathway,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
If anything is gonna sell,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
The man there said he loved my sound,
One summer's day he came passing by,
I shall be released,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
So glad,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
The light I never knowed,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Eh, see what you can do,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I don't wanna fake you out,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
"Not me," said his manager,
But I know that he don't talk,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Father of night, father of day,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Strike another match, go start anew,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Don't steal, don't lift,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I try my best to be like I am,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
But I've been hanging on,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
To keep up his hate,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Come all without, come all within,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Ever since I been a child,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
But you try with your whole soul,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
To be on your own,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Madams light the candles,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
And forget my pride,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
New morning,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
You wanna drown love,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
But it would not be new,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
When I was in Missouri,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Go down to the river, babe,
Whether you are right or wrong,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
A million faces at my feet,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Dream about you, baby,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
They keep it all hid,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Precious father, loving mother,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
To be without a home,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
All them prophets good and gone,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
He got that soft, silky skin,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I just don't know what to do,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
First degree and second degree,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I wish I a-was a magician,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
And the table's full and overflowed,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Cares not to come up any higher,
God knows it's terrifying,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
I got my mind made up,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Love that's pure no accident,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
That can do what's never been done,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Using every angle under the sun,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
The kingdoms of experience,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Said I'm pressing on,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Thinking about the government,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Don't matter what you did,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
God knows everything,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
With his fist in a clinch,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
But he's the property of Jesus,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
In the turning of twilight,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Already the fiesta has begun,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
A thousand miles from home,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
The sky too is folding under you,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Trust yourself,
Carry the New York Times,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
And it ain't me, babe,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
It still ain't me, babe,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Without ideals or violence,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
If I didn't have to guess,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
It was you who came right through,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
At ships with tattooed sails,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
We'll go someplace unknown,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
In the hills of mystery,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
And give him back the time he's done,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Wintertime in New York town,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Had a dream about you, baby,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Broken hands on broken plows,
He's young and on fire,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Got me a secret membership card,
She never does me wrong,
Not the end, not the end,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
I can change, I swear,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
May be living in another country under another name,
Ten thousand men on the move,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
The carpet too is moving under you,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Oh, see what you can do,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
As the daylight hours do increase,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
She'll surely turn to white,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
I got a bird that whistles,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Well, I'm pressing on,
He's not selling any alibis,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
The day would surely have to break,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
This world is ruled by violence,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
How does it feel,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
When she lays upon the grass,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Well, get sick, get well,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
The train leaves at half past ten,
If you throw it all away,
To be so useless and all,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Don't ever try to change me,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
People carry roses,
I been good,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
In the lonely night,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Just like a rolling stone,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Judge and jury took their stand,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I've been around this whole country,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
They lowered him down as a king,
A complete unknown,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
While riding on a train going west,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
I wish tonight were here,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Need a woman all the time,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
That five walls cannot hide him,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
See her in that very tight skirt,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Fare thee well but for a while,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
You got to serve somebody,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Keep me where you are,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
And to come every time you call,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
We never much thought we could get very old,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
It always means so much,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
God knows it's fragile,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Ye shall be changed,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Three angels up above the street,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Go away from my window,
If not for you,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Going, going, gone,
Get back, write Braille,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
And it's like I ain't here,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
To your tambourine in time,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
That her father was going to hang,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Looking for a new fool,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Staying far behind without you,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Too noble to neglect,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Never did feel this way before,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Strangers all give me the news,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
You follow, find yourself at war,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Seem like I been down this way before,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
A true love of mine,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Well, come all without, come all within,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
No, nothing was delivered,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Yes, and I'll go last,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I went into the city, went into the town,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Under the microscope,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Father of cold and father of heat,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Since you've been gone,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
She said she would always stay,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
And, if I see the day,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
When there is no more,
Holding his club like he was a king,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Like a complete unknown,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Waiting for the trains,
They say every man must need protection,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Tell me,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Relationships of ownership,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
I bless the day I found you,
All I really wanna do,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
You have given all there is to give,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
And think they're fooling you,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
But, deep inside my heart,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
And you know I could never be your own,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
And every cause that ever I fought,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Can't find what I need,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Never weak, but always strong,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
No direction home,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
As his youth now unfolds,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Had no one to go my bail,
Heart of mine, be still,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
In the instant that I preach,
They––they show me to the door,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
You to me were true,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Precious angel under the sun,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I can make it through,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Or select you or dissect you,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
And she aches just like a woman,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
I would not feel so all alone,
God knows it's a struggle,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Of this I can't say very much,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
But, to remain as friends,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
He is centuries old,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
But now morning is clear,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
But the time ain't tall,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Without a love of my own,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
They say every man needs protection,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
My love, she speaks softly,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
You got something better,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Stone you just like they said they would,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
It always has hit me from below,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
To hide 'neath a hood,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Six months on the chain gang,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
It don't matter what you did,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Tell her not to worry,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Nothing too very scientific,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Don't let me change my heart,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Someone to open each and every door,
When the night comes falling,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Watered-down love,
Watch the plain-clothes,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
To a solid rock,
"Come along and take a trip,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
To protect his white skin,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
In the image of someone you used to know,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Up and down the block,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Without a dream in my heart,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Laying low,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Don't follow leaders,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Automobile coming into style,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Don't you tell Henry,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Read books and repeat quotations,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
It's a price I have to pay,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Tell me that you love me only,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
God knows it's outta sight,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I got a wife and five little children,
We've killed each one,
Most of the time it's well understood,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Advertising signs, they con,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Drifting too far from shore,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Go melt back in the night,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Every nerve is analyzed,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
I went down to scrub and rub,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Where mercy walks the plank,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
God knows you ain't pretty,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
And you make love just like a woman,
The angels play on their horns all day,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
I've been saved – well, alright,
God knows there's a river,
And your streets are getting empty,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
She got great big hind legs,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Don't let me drift too far,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Makes no difference where she's been,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Watching the river flow,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
For she ain't the same,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
You need something to open up a new door,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
And I'm just like that bird,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
With no direction home,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
With the juice running down my leg,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
That fellow who never blushes,
Oh, Angelina,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Yesterday's just a memory,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
The only son of God Almighty,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Puffing on a big cigar,
I can't be good, baby,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
I threw it all away,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
God knows how to make it flow,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
True love, they've been without it,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
I want my arms around you,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
People going down to the ground,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
One more night the stars are in sight,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
On the stone that remains,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Get born, keep warm,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Don't let yourself fall,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
That fired the gun,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Aim well, my little one,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
I'm going down the river,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
You can run down to the desert,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Well, well, well,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
I had so much left to do,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Baby, please stop crying,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
The winter would hold no spring,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Get jailed, jump bail,
You gotta look some other place,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Loyalty, unity,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
My existence led by confusion boats,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Mercury, gravity,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
I'm going back to Colorado,
And I got the worried blues,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Vanished from my hand,
Don't let her see that you need her,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
And she'll be coming forth,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
By users, cheaters,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
People talk over situations,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Joey, Joey,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Give you my money, honey,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
It's like I ain't here,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Well, I can't understand,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
There's always someone who understands,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
For something that he never done,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
There she come, now, down my way,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Read books, repeat quotations,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
To shine in through,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
By losers, cheaters,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
I'm leaving today,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
The air is getting hotter,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
It's alright,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I long to see you in the morning light,
You'll change your last name, too,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
You can stick your head in the sand,
The night would see me wide awake,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
God knows there's a chance,
For all intended purposes,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
You need something to open your eyes,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
You made it there somehow,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Stay away from the train line,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
I just keep pressing on,
Try hard, get barred,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
To be one your own,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Each time we meet, love,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Into my own parade,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
The country music station plays soft,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Searching high, searching low,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
And pretend that we never have touched,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And I––I walk out on my own,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Nothing was delivered,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Make you spin or do you in,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
I'm so glad,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
It could even be like a myth,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
We live in a political world,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I went out last night to take a little round,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
So unknown,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Heart of mine,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Is used, it is plain,
Well, I'm so glad,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
I'm never, never far from home,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Hmm, I can make it through,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Where life and death are memorized,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Keep a clean nose,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Don't mind the driving rain,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
The Second World War came to an end,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Yet every distance is not near,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Don't tie no bows,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Like you never did before,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
As the present now will later be past,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Why she did go,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
And, if I can save you any time,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Just like I did before,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Over the hills and far away,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
How many a year has passed and gone,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Private reasons, great or small,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Father who build the mountain so high,
And to come each time you call,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Now you don't talk so loud,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Like a dog on a chain,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Oxford Town around the bend,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
That the laws are with him,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
My limbs are shaking,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
I'd only have to stay,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
I got no place left to turn,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
So, never leave me lonely,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
You and me, we had completeness,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
See you fly or watch you die,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I been riding the midnight train,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
It hurts me, too,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Don't let her see,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
You're beautiful to me,
Father of loneliness and pain,
The joint is jumping,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
I rambled out of New York town,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
You better duck down the alleyway,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
That long, black train is pulling down,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Far away in the stormy night,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
And gathering storms may arise,
Front door shut, back door too,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I never can go because, you know,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
You got something I want plenty of,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
And here I sit so patiently,
And may you stay forever young,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
That they do not respect in any degree,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
I just can't beg you anymore,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Don't let her hear,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
In the darkness of my night,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
The path you've endured has been rough,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Where I will always be renewed,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Oh, watered-down love,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
But the bottles are done,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
You could look at it and weep,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
And furnish me with tape,
You have explained every mystery,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Ain't no going back,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
From their fates try to resign,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Roll, Willie, roll,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
But I'm saved,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Went back home to the yard,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
She said she would never forget,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Looking 'bout the government,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
A question in your nerves is lit,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
True love of mine,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
I can see the turning of the key,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
God knows it's a crime,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Seven days,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Going,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
You don't want a love that's pure,
May you stay forever young,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And it's only that I'm asking,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Stone you when you are young and able,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Never needed to call you my whore,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I won't have my nature way,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Ye shall be a-changed,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Saved,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
I tried to reach you, honey,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
She once was a true love of mine,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
My woman needs it every day,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Don't try No Doz,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
That foreign sound in your ear,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
My dear, sweet friend,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
And joined the John Birch Society,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
That can do what's a-never been done,
And I know what you're thinking of,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Hmm, see what you can do,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
In one the surface was frozen,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
If'n you don't know by now,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Icicles hanging down,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
At the close of the day,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
You were striped, you were plain,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Forever young, forever young,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
God sees it all unfold,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I ain't looking to block you up,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
China doll, alcohol,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
And also by his feet,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
But something has changed,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Thieving in the alley,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
And the point is slick,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Memory, ecstasy,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
They say that every man must fall,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
If you'd see me this way,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Newspapermen eating candy,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Made of silver or of golden,
I got those worried blues,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Look out, kid,
Well, there ain't no going back,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
But, if I can save you any time,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
The man in the trench-coat,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Thank You, Lord,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
The one we can see and can feel,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Heart of mine, go back home,
They must bust in early May,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
But, if I will save you the time,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Winter would have no spring,
And, though the line is cut,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I got two white horses following me,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
A man with a badge skips by,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
In the shadows of moonlight,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
I try my best to be just like I am,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
And the sooner you come up with them,
I swung on to my old guitar,
To find out if she's talked,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Paradise, sacrifice,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Of ancient history,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
God knows when,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
In the foggy web of destiny,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Stripping away at it all,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
While paupers change possessions,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
God knows there's a heaven,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Well, I gave you all my money,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Just then the order came to charge,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
With what your fate is going to be,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
You can raise up your right hand,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
They don't believe in mercy,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
And come every time you call,
Yesterday is just a memory,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Gonna serve somebody,
The night blows cold and rainy,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
We take great delight in our own company,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
I'd give you the sky high above,
We'll fly the night away,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
He's the property of Jesus,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Silvio, I gotta go,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Loneliness, tenderness,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
I think we better talk this over,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
I'm going out of my mind,
You want watered-down love,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
I have no one to meet,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
But evidently she don't,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
And I'm in the shade,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
In love and with kindness,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
They tell me every man must fall,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Circled by the circus sands,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
I like the way that you move your hips,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
When I seen him lose control,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Rabbit running down across the road,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Who could they get to carry you,
Pressing on,
The beat is pumping,
It's rising up above my head,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Better jump down a manhole,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
This situation can only get rougher,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Each one playing a horn,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
The day you quit me, baby,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And on the highway of regret,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Every moon is so sanctified,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
And the whole world is on your case,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
More people kept a-piling on,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
It was from her ship sailing,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
God knows you've got to weep,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
To hang and to lynch,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
That two healers cannot heal him,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
But I'm pressing on,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
The sky too is folding over you,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
You married young just like your ma,
Look away, you rolling river,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Is looking for a new fool,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Till both of us fell by the way,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Light yourself a candle,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Don't wanna be a bum,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
How he died nobody could say,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
And, although that we're single and free,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Corrina, Corrina,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
He won't do nothing to you,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Don't let her know,
Look who's back in town,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
I went back home, put on my tie,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
I march in the parade of liberty,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
I got the worried blues,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
All the silver, all the gold,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
You have given everything to me,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
God don't call it treason,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Resent him to the bone,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Love don't have any place,
Simplify you, classify you,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
My arms and legs were broken,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Broken switches, broken gates,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
A hand set the spark,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
I get my sweet reward,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
The country doctor rambles,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
If ever I prove false to you,
I went down where the vultures feed,
But you were gambling for support,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
The night passed away so quickly,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
I want you so bad,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Everything's a-hers or his,
May be an actor in a plot,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Watch the river flow,
That must be what it's all about,
Two by two they step in the dark,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Something about you that I can't shake,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Or have done something wrong,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
I just say no thanks,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
And point away from the past,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Father of air and father of trees,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Day you quit me, baby,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Badge out, laid off,
Too serious to fool,
Get dressed, get blessed,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
And not going through any great extreme,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Analyze you, categorize you,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
But it ain't me, babe,
Face full of black soot,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Every head is so dignified,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Got my mind made up,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Going home,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Stand up straight and tall,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Someone to close his heart,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Like a rolling stone,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
But you're doing it again,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Don't let yourself stumble,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Out to the windy beach,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
My hands can't feel to grip,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Better jump down the manhole,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
You'll be doing society a favor,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
You better chew gum,
In the end,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
And all of your children start to resent you,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
She's opened up a happy home,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
I should have left this town this morning,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I just don't see why I should even care,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Father of black, father of white,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
To be alone with you,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
One by one they follow the sun,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
I'd be sad and blue,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
To be out on your own,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
To stay closer than any friend,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Now, won't you tell me true,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I'd already gone the distance,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Baby, let me follow you down,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
You have given me eyes to see,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
With a killer's pride, security,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
By rivers of blindness,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
That four ears cannot hear him,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
You've got to serve somebody,
She would have married me,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Precious memories, how they linger,
People talk of situations,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
To know how much I really care,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
All you can do is do what you must,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Just to know that you are near,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Bring the wife and family,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Serve somebody,
Friends with you,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
In the great unknown,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Mixing up the medicine,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
She leave by the other and roam,
It's too bad he had to go,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
It's not aimed at anyone,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Try to be a success,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
God knows that, when you see it,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
To gather flowers constantly,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
One by one until there were none,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
They say everything can be replaced,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
She'll be coming forth,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Is it really any wonder,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
He been around the world and back again,
For his age he is wise,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Father of minutes, father of days,
You even make love just like a woman,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
But, if you want me to,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
I landed up on the downtown side,
And I'm so glad,
They say every man need protection,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
For her to arrive,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Grandpa died last week,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Well, I may just swear,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
On this new morning, new morning,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
It was a girl I learned it from,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
When all will be well,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Going, going,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
One by one they followed the sun,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
In a pine box for all eternity,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Father of day, father of night,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Like some mystery,
For the politician's gain,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Just don't know what to do,
Like as not, it's better so,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Want you so bad,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Ooh, watered-down love,
If you must cling to someone,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
I need a shot of love,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Eh, singing just for you,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Carved next to his name,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Just remember that death is not the end,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
I went into the city, into the town,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
God knows it's true,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
I know I can't win,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
I want you,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
You don't have to feed me,
You have given me life to live,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
A dream about you, baby,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Who will promise never to part,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
The wind howls like a hammer,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
You were snow, you were rain,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Stone you and say good luck,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
If she ain't feeling well,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
God don't call it wrong,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
And I'm back in the rain,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Far away from it all,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
But it ain't him to blame,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
And I got those worried blues,
For the wise men and the fools,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Hang around the ink-well,
That you'd have liked me to,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
In his anger and his shame,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Drag you down or drain you down,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
And, if anybody asks me,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
And you take just like a woman,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I thank the Lord,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Speaking to some French girl,
And played the fife lowly,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
That's where you belong --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Democracy don't rule the world --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
I can't hear you anymore.
And laid his life on the line.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
Everything is broken.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
As the present now will later be past.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
It's just the old American way.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
We were the wrong side.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
I would only let you down.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
"Don't point your finger at me.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
And wait for succeeding kings.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
I'll only let you down.
And I need you, ah.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Tell me that it isn't true.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
If you just let me come home with you.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
I'm younger than that now.
I hope you're ready.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
They want me for a gambling fight.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
You're a big girl now.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
But I would never do you wrong.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
My baby stole my heart from me.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
You don't have to be afraid.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
And I've never been too impressed.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Someone to open each and every door.
I'm a poet, I know it.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Waiting on my burying ground.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Till your error you clearly learn.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
Suffering like a fool.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
I want you.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Must be and that is all.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
And crime don't have a face.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
You're my baby.
You know the song in my heart.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
In the dark land of the sun.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
The words that her lover had said.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Hope I don't blow it.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
I been worrying about you, baby.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
And light on your right knee.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
The whole night through.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
The next day could be your last.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
For the saving grace that's over me.
"And stay all night with me.
Under the hedges.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
To kill with no pain.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
Put me outta doors.
At not getting their money's worth.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
You know, I loved her just the same.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Going, going, gone.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
That set everybody free.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Lord, protect my child.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
You cast your spell and I went under.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
But these to tell what's true.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
But it was more than I could do.
You'd better get that in your head.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Father of love and father of rain.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
I know something is changed.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
After losing every battle.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
I hope I'm ready.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
I need a shot of love.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
People sleeping in broken beds.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
That can win what's never been won.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
And there's no time to think.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
By that soft and shining sea.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
I once held her in my arms.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Last radio is playing.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Because everybody must get stoned.
You won't get it for money.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
And watch the parking meters.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
That Johanna's not here.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Figuring a way to get back home.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
It runs both cold and deep.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Walking around with no one else.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
There were six thousand people there.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
I said that.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Nobility, humility.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
I just can't do what I done before.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Madams light the candles.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
I can't see through it anymore.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
While my conscience explodes.
When my working day's through.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Is gonna be against the law.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
I got trouble in my mind.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
And keep away from pranks.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Look a-the other way.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Just what this song is all about.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
And gives it to me for a song.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Without ideals or violence.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Know not what the years may hold.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Trying to create a next world war.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
See like me or be like me.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
'Steada acting like we never met.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
And your golden loom.
And no time to think.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
With gold and silver in her hand.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
What's real and what is not.
I'll be your baby tonight.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
You don't have to worry any more.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
The National Guard stands around his door.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Come on, darling.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
But you're back where you belong.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Have fallen from her curls.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Using ideas as my maps.
To see that you're madly in love.
Going back where we come from.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Saying wants company.
I been in this thing too long.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
When she's better only time'll tell.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
I did not do it knowingly.
I can't shoot them anymore.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
It'll never do, somehow.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
And then unto eternity.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
I's looking around just to see myself.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Ever since I seen you there.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
As if a wedding vow.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Can't see over to the other side.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
He's got his mother's eyes.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Honey, I want you.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Is tearing up your mind.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
And pretend that we never have touched.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Just what he was talking about.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
A man named Martin Luther King...
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Mine alone.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
And relive my dreams.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
The last radio is playing.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
He's always on trial for just being born.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Step lightly on the ground.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
That's really and truly an American.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
For the times, they are a-changing.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Tell me.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
You're drifting too far from shore.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Until my dying-day.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Just crying out that he was framed.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
In the pale moonlight.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
What looks like the easy way out.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
You sound like a hillbilly.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
All because his face was brown.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Honey, come and see about me.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
In the night the price was paid.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
There was nobody around.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
She's in some foreign land.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Chain you down or bring you down.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.

Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
And I'll go last.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
She acts like we never met.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.

I don't even know why we come.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
She pretends like we never have met.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.

Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I know you always say that you agree.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Watch the parking meters.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Up and down the lonesome town.
But the fighter still remains.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
While I'm in the hall.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
So the radio didn't work so well.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Kisses she gave him three.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Thought I was a communist.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
I'm going where I never been before.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
My love, she speaks softly.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
Unless they're from another world.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
And each one I've never seen again.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
I got nothing left to burn.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
I froze right to the bone.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Precious memories flood my soul.
There's no words that need to be said.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
But you break just like a little girl.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
I will only let you down.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
Never will want for money.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
But I can't get close to her at all.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Said it was a bad dream.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
And your highway's getting filled.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
I hate bears.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
From the little Minnesota town.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Just to take somebody's money away.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
The night will soon be gone.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
It don't matter anyhow.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
My love winks, she does not bother.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Dollar a day's worth.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Where I was born and partly raised.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Crumble into one another.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
On the caboose of the train.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
His voice was low with pain.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
By the saving grace that's over me.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
Yes, tell me.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
A true love of mine.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
That last night I was with.
The sooner you can leave.
All because of the color of his skin.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
Every link was Jesus's name.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Duality, mortality.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Come over here from over there, girl.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
To anything I might've tried.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Soft as music, light as spring.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Mortality, reality.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Someone who will die for you and more.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Lay dead beside him there.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
See him at play makes me smile.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
We may not make it through the night.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
The hour that the ship comes in.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Or put up against the wall.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Leading me, going home.
When you go your way and I go mine.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
People bending broken rules.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Honey, I never would have come.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
Go lightly on the ground.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Foundationed deep somehow.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
You got a heart of stone.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
But simply because it's true.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
It was you who understood.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Blood on your saddle.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
And the Santa Fe.
Wasn't any difference to me.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
To which a scoundrel clings.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Hmm.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
Girls like birds fly away.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
I had something to protect.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
And ye shall be changed.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
I couldn't find any.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
That I left in the French Quarter.
For me to return to or chase.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Havanageeluh.
That brave and devoted band.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Tangled up in blue.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
But you were tangled up in blue.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
In an oil refinery.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
"Get well, get well," said she.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
That must be what it's all about.
Neighborhood bully.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
When my memory is not so short.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Rain would gather too.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
I can walk anytime around the block.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Everything is gonna be alright.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Blues wrapped around my head.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
To be alone with you.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Hear me singing through these tears.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I took some comfort there.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Or define you or confine you.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
And you only got ten.
His mama sure was proud of him.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
Humility, simplicity.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Some speak of the future.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Reality has always had too many heads.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
She just acts like we never have met.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
She murdered mortal he.
No kindred or relative nigh.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
I long to reach for you in the night.
You're a big girl all the way.
You always got more than enough rope.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Going through all these things twice.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
At the end of the trail.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
To live it you had to explode.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Looking for the places only they would know.
You got it, baby.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Bring that bottle over here.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Wants to get it paid off.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
And say you'll always let it be me.
But mine was a little different, you see.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
His enemies say he's on their land.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
And time is beginning to crawl.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
You may not see me tomorrow.
And I's left alone with three children.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
To keep her from the howling winds.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Good as I been to you.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
In the border-towns of despair.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
I can't fire them anymore.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
I find it so difficult to leave.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
You're too hot, darling.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Who says she knows me well.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Remember me to one who lives there.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
He's the neighborhood bully.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Tried to create a next world war.
I want everybody to be free.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
That's the way I remember her best.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
In the brightness of my day.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Magic in a magical land.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
It would go up against every rule.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Just you and me.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Bid farewell forever.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
It don't matter, anyhow.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
With your golden loom.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
In the palace of the Pope.
Friends with you.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
With the golden loom.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
My baby took my heart from me.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Just like so many times before.
You can say I didn't give to you.
I got a bird that sings.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Don't remember one thing more.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
That number eleven was closing.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
At my window with a broken wing.
Or inspect you or reject you.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
For that's the way I remember her best.
So many people I never saw in my life.
When I run outta things to investigate.
If I ride back again.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
She can't find him anywhere.
I just go pump on it some.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
To reach of your rattling drums.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
For your times, they are a-changing.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Epitome, rigidity.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
So quickly into autumn.
To anything I might have tried.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
You are on the bottom.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
The light I never knowed.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
I threw it all away.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
I don't know.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Trust yourself.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
That old ship was a-going down.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
But I know that I can't move.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Means another poor boy is underground.
I'd like to know.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
Crying out that he been framed.
Down to New Orleans.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
They both rode off together.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
I only saw what they let me see.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Down along my restless palms.
She once was a true love of mine.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
New morning.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Chain you down or be your clown.
I see better days and I do better things.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Hope you're ready.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Six by six...
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
To anything I mighta tried.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
Finalize you or advertise you.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.

In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.

This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:

In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:

A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Till I come into New York town:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
His epitaph plain:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Man is opposed to fair play:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
But there's one promise, darling:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
I find complete love;
Had to be held down by big police;
All lies and jest;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Make promises by the hour;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Some speak of the future;
Crumble into one another;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>

<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<p>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
How long are we gonna be riding?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
For all these earthly things?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Have they missed you?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
That too many people have died?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
When he's standing in front of you?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Can you get back in?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Oh, how could you refuse?
What would life be?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Are you ready?
How much poison did they inhale?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Baby, what more can I tell?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
By golly, what more can I say?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
What else can a poor boy do?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Before you call him a man?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Why would I want to take your life?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
How many more without any reward?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Who's gonna let it roll?
How many compared to yesterday?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Where did you lose your wings?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Of everything you see?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Across the swamp of time?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Like a rolling stone?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
How does it feel?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Just what in the world has come over you?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
And one deserving of affection?
Too many people have died?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
What can I give to You?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
How many paths did they try and fail?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
When did you leave heaven?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
How's everything in heaven?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Can I come home with you?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Has anybody seen my love?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Does anyone even try?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
How can I live for You?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Don't you remember making baby love?
What can I do for You?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Am I ready?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
How many more can they afford?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Before they're forever banned?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Who you thought you were talking to?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
And how does it feel?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Just like a rolling stone?
What's wrong with you this time?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
To love and follow His direction?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Baby, can't you tell?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Gal, where you been so long?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Before it is washed to the sea?
What good am I?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Where did you hide your halo?
Must everybody bow?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Across the swooping plain?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Why and what's the reason for?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
How could they ever mistake you?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before he can hear people cry?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
How could they let you go?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
It was put together down in Argentina
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
"Equality". I spoke the word
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Either from the mountains of Madrid
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
It's something you did
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
All the sweethearts you can hold
For what you sold that's not been received
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
While some, on principles baptized
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Many times I've often prayed
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
I've been walking around
I thought that it was well-understood
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
He wagged his tail and shook his head
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Nothing was delivered
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
I live in another world
But now something has changed
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now you don't seem so proud
And your trouble is you know it too good
Just what you had in mind
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
I had to say something to strike him very weird
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now, a very great man once said
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Maybe someday you will understand
I want you, baby, just to understand
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
And those whom doom and death had spared
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I still can remember the way that you smiled
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Silvio, silver and gold
You used––be so proud
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Now, whenever I get up and
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
And then you told me later as I apologized
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
We live in a political world
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
I run right home and I went to bed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
They took a clean-cut kid
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
But all that suffering was not to be compared
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
I'll always thank the Lord
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
To see him obviously framed
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
You try so hard, but you don't understand
You used to be so amused
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
So I'll make my stand
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And things would be different the next time we wed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Things would be different the next time we wed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I will not go down under the ground
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Somebody seen him hanging around
And that even the nobles get properly handled
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Now you don't act so––so proud
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
How many times can a man turn his head
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
By no special friend
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Its iron claws attached
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
He was a clean-cut kid
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
There ain't nothing in this world
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
As I stand upon the sand
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
And into the path you are hurled
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
But she ain't gonna find the road
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
The changes I was going through can't even be used
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
But something has changed
She let go of my hand
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Better stay away from those
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
If dogs run free, then what must be
She knows there's no success like failure
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
She plunged him into well water where
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
From the Golden Gate Bridge
From the start by the rule
With all memory and fate
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Well, six white horses that you did promise
A bed that is never mine
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Taking care of somebody nice
The cause was there before we came
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
But I can get another one
But the dark does die
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
If dogs run free, why not me
To give the special one you seek a chance
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
You're not free to belong to me
You know, it's not even safe no more
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
It'll be with me unto the grave
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
To show you something you seen before
And I ain't complaining none
And you see why it's so unique to be
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
I rode with him in a taxi once
But I can't say I sympathize
Just what you will say when you get home
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
You cut to the core
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Most of the time I can't even be sure
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
So I look like a walking mountain range
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
All I feel is heat and flame
Among the lovely people living free
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Limited in sex they dare
Waiting to find out what price
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Up into some paradise
Should I leave them by your gate
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
There were times when I was so lonesome
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
At dawn my lover comes to me
You just pick anyone
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
On the rising curve
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Hunger pays a heavy price
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
It's getting dark, too dark to see
What good am I then to others and me
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
And plenty time for good romance
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
You into thinking you're the one
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
What's probably got you baffled more
When the roses fade
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
I been wondering all about me
Little did I realize
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
We see this empty cage now corrode
And I would send a message
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Remember me to the one who lives there
And suddenly there appeared before me
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
So I remember every face
Just pick anyone
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Mona tried to tell me
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Full of hope and desire
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And never sat once at the head of the table
And that is that one must always flush out his house
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
As he rises to fame
He'll see by his grave
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
So up she picked her babies three
You say you're looking for someone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Knows there's no success like failure
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
If dogs run free, why not we
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Well, it's all new to me
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
From all the plans they do pursue
That she's the same one
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
A girl who would murder her own, true love
What about that millionaire
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Leaving men wholly, totally free
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
But it won't be over till they clear his name
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
The man the authorities came to blame
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The crashing waves roll over me
Maybe someday you will look back and see
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
It's all new to me
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
What you're gonna say when you get home
How many ears must one man have
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
And I'm just the same as anyone else
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Says it's closing time
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Feel to moan, but unlike before
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
While them that defend what they cannot see
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
But I feel nothing for their game
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
So, I called up the operator of time
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
She been gone
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
I can survive and I can endure
I'm ready for to fade
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
You said you'd never compromise
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
See the primitive wallflower freeze
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
You could almost think that you're seeing double
They say don't come back no more
When I'm all alone
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Lies that life is black-and-white
I am homeless, come and take me
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
"It's only you that he does crave
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
And the Negro's name
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
I'm sure you're the one to blame
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
How was I to know you'd be the one
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
I don't even notice she gone
I do declare
Remember me to one who lives there
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Should I put them by your gate
Though its shadow's metal badge
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
When Reilly's daughter got a message
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
When the rain is blowing in your face
Why wait any longer for the one you love
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And the cards are no good that you're holding
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
For your weary toes to be touching
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
The battle outside raging
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And there's no telling who that it's naming
I know that you know that I know that you show something
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
If I was with her too long
But then a whistle will be blowing
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
What am I saying? What am I knowing
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
'Cause the battle outside raging
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Where the time and the tempo drag
Well, I set my monkey on the log
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Deceived me into thinking
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
She rode by night and came by morning
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
It's not a bad way to make a living
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
The order is a-rapidly fading
I can hear their hearts a-beating
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
The order is rapidly fading
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
There's nothing in here moving
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
They're drinking up and walking
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I have fallen far beneath
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Then she told us how times were tough
You go north and you go south
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And how I know I'll make it through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Look out, the saints are coming through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Her voice once and talk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
You turn around to take a final peek
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Shoot in the back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Well, there ain't no going back
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
The man in me will do nearly any task
I wish she'd unlock
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
And if my love is real
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
How many seas must a white dove sail
Ring bar, hard to tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
A girl by the whirlpool
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Oh, how does it feel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
How many seas must the white dove sail
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
As the last fire-truck from hell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
All and all can only fall
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
They ask me how I feel
He's sure got a lot of gall
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Ring bell, hard to tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
He's taught in his school
To make all that should be killed to crawl
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Well, if I die on top of the hill
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Then why don't she tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
How does it feel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
A-how does it feel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And remain as I am
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But I can hear another drum
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You better not chew gum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Two eyes took the aim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
"For you cannot relive them
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Somebody new to beat on
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
But it's hard to think on
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
He got that fortress on the mountain
You don't need a weatherman
And there's no exit in any direction
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
She got such a sweet disposition
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Advertising signs that con
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Please don't let on that you knew me when
In the pigpen
Why did you trade heaven
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Their religion of the little ten women
I figure maybe we're even
That long, black train is pulling on down
But I swear I see my reflection
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Yet I swear I see my reflection
I don't even care if I ever see her again
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
That long, black train is pulling down
For the loser now might be later to win
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Will not be understood as they're spoken
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
I'll be waiting at the station
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Suicide remarks are torn
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Well, you fake just like a woman
My love, she's like some raven
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
For the loser now will be later to win
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
But the post office has been stolen
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
All their daughters put me down
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
"Not me," said the gambling man
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
And all their daughters put me down
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And she aches just like a woman
Well, I'm hanging on
She takes just like a woman
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
To my knowledge there's just one man
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
As they rode him in custody down to the station
You take just like a woman
The ones that jump on the wagon
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Have died in battle or in vain
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Trying to get a lead on
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Uncle Rat went running downtown
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Darkness at the break of noon
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Out of the shower comes a football man
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
As you sit on the box you keep him in
She said that all the railroad men
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
To remember the times when I was your only man
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
And you ache a-just like a woman
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
From heights that they could not gain
How many roads must a man walk down
A-she takes just like a woman
You need something to make it known
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
But the second mom was with the seventh son
And the corner sign
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But me, I expected it to happen
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
How can the life of such a man
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Yes, and someone must explain
But the second mother was with the seventh son
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Guns and clubs followed him down
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
The next morning she had awoken
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
But all their daughters put me down
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Must meet the dawn
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
And she wakes just like a woman
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
There's nothing you can say or do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
There is a place you go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
All I'd like you to do
Silvio, I gotta go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Every place I wanna go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
All I really wanna do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
What good am I while you softly weep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Man in the coon-skin cap
I walked down there and ended up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
How many times must a man look up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Aladdin and his lamp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
The man in the coon-skin cap
I could feel a whole lot better
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Still I say her love-words over
So, don't fear if you hear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The face of God will appear
Alone you stand with nobody near
Never no more do I wonder
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
For I am married to a house carpenter
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
I don't have to go far
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
She took him by his long, yellow hair
You heard me saying a prayer for
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
When only you are near
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
I close my eyes and I wonder
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
The wind howls like a hammer
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
And I don't even think about her
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
In one I was running and in another
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Still I've always kind of missed her
I say, "Why you say that for
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
The lover who has just walked out your door
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
But morning is clear
At any moment you could go under
For all eternity I think I will remember
Who came here from Cuba's door
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
When you whispered in my ear
All you boys better run for cover
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Don't wear sandals
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
But still remains
That it's you and no one else that owns
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Her window's wide open, African trees
You never turned around to see the frowns
And then complains
Glide across the lonely years
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And the poor white remains
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
But, though the masters make the rules
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And your father, to your sister he explains
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Don't follow leaders
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
As friends and other strangers
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
The cowboy angel rides
I try to tell it like it is
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
How many deaths will it take till he knows
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Romantic facts of musketeers
I'd gladly confess
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
You know that he has no intentions
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
True love can make a blade of grass
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Girl by the whirlpool's
What good am I if I say foolish things
At times I think there are no words
Wants eleven dollar bills
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Seven days
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
The empty-handed painter from your streets
People on the platforms
To sharpen the senses
And inside it with the people made of molasses
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And tells me of her dreams
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Six-time users
Well, the ragman draws circles
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Good and bad, I define these terms
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
I'm gonna let you pass
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
"Not me," said the man whose fists
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
They whisper in the wings
To memorizing politics
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
And the princess and the prince discuss
Now, you must provide some answers
Statues made of matchsticks
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And without further notice asks you how it feels
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
You can fall down on your knees
People carry roses
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And I try to harmonize with songs
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
On the back of the fish truck that loads
You been hurt so many times
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And so Patty calls the cops
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You should be made to wear earphones
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I was thinking of a series of dreams
To the cutting of fences
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Six-time losers
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
We living in times when men commit crimes
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
With a big bouquet of the roses
When your mother sends back all your invitations
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
He's not selling any alibis
Thinking of a series of dreams
And, though the masters make the rules
Mama, you know, awaits the news
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
In the dimestores and bus-stations
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
And the first one now will later be last
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
You're gonna get hit
That might be all that you got
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
You are there in the flickering light
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I'm on the pavement
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
And, since my feet are now fast
Plants in the bed, but
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Wait for the morning light
I got into the driver's seat
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Keep it in your mind and not forget
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Talking that the heat put
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Everyone still talks about
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
She seems too far out
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
You don't forget
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
But, if the arrow is straight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
To keep it in your mind and not forget
There's some people that
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
How many years can some people exist
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
You used to laugh about
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
They tell me revenge is sweet
I soon get some rest
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
You're hearing my heart beat
The slowest now will later be fast
Everything is always right
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
I think that it's best
Without any doubt
Someday, everything is gonna be different
One more night the moon is shining bright
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Johnny's in the basement
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
With your pockets well protected at last
Keep me set apart
So he never thinks straight
And I, in my armor, turning about
It don't take too long to find out
He built a fire on Main Street
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
In the stillness of the midnight
One more night I will wait for the light
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
To hold each other tight
In the precious winds they rot
He really wasn't where it's at
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
The slow one now will later be fast
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
How many years can a mountain exist
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
By the way, that's a cute hat
But, then again, there's only one I've met
You used to laugh–make fun about
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
They tell me to be discreet
I'll remember you
To be alone with you
I can be just like you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To protect you and defend you
It's just crazy being here with you
And I tell this truth to you
I just might have to come see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always a-go to show
Yes, I'd sure like to know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
The only one I know
I'd sure like to know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
With only you in view
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
He been living there three years now
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Sooner or later one of us must know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
It only goes to show
Well, I'd sure like to know
But sooner or later one of us must know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Don't it always go to show
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
No, you'll not now or no other day
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Or if you just want some company
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
The Spanish-American War had its day
That I done it the way
Someone to get you flowers constantly
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And the ladies treat me kindly
To those condemned to act accordingly
And that which you've given me today
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Maggie says that many say
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Don't you tell Henry
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
So I run down most hurriedly
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Spouted out that liberty
I send you all my money
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
My mind weaves a symphony
Though I'd never say
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
From phony jealousy
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
So, I'm walking down your highway
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
For them that must obey authority
But I wish there was something you would do or say
She puts it to me plain as day
For them that think death's honesty
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
She starts to speak, but he walks away
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
That I was just a puppet in a play
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
And the only tune my guitar could play
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Well, I'm walking down the highway
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
My ears hear a symphony
If I don't take the chance to try
And it's up to you to say
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
The same thing I would want today
She knocked upon it anyway
So they took him to the infirmary
A cock is crowing far away
But I can't deny
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
And for His love they took His life away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Is worth more than I could pay
Went to the doctor the very next day
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
For them that think death––death's honesty
We banged the drum slowly
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
And I'm leaving every day to run away
I did not do it harmfully
She smiles, walks the other way
But you can never steal away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
I hope that you can hear––
Oh, my–
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Havana–gee–
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Hava–na–
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Whispering your secret emotion –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
To know where you are –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
You will not hear a laugh –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Indians camp along her border –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Private reasons – great or small –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
With no other choice except but for to go –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Leave all the children home –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
With notions his canoe was laden –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
I'm sure it was not three –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
First degree and second degree –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
It can't be this way everywhere –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
How badly they were shocked –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Disconnect these cables––
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Havanagee–luh–
As suicide remarks are torn –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
I long to hold you in the night –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Hang out the whole next day –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Ha–va–
Haven't seen her since that night –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
I got no idea what I want –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
I a-hope you can hear––
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
