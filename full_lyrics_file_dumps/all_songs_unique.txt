Oh, yeah!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
Start over!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!

The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!

She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!

So long, New York!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Hope I don't find out too much!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
She's insane!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Well!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Woo!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
You're a liar!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Yeah, man!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Dignity never been photographed!
They was all over!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
I discovered there was red stripes in the American flag!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
Alright, now!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Yippee!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Alright!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
It was the mailman!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Woo-hoo!
Betty Ross!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
You must think I'm crazy!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
My God, they killed Him!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!

They got away!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
They were all over!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
The ones on Hootenanny!
I figured they was in my television set!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Play fucking loud!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Them Reds did it!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
He punched me out!
How they ever flood my soul!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Take me down to California, baby!
Thank you!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
I've got the freight train blues!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I can't find my knees."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
So write to her tenderly."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "Don't tell me, let me guess your name,"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Have it on Highway 61."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
You must know about my debutante."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
You can't blame me at all."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
That you must always first forgive them."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
They look as white as snow."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
You can't blame us at all."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
We'll both go off together."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
God said, "On Highway 61."
They look as dark as night."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
For that reason I will have to stay."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I love far better than thee."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Come flowing down so free?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
And it's all for the love of thee."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
I didn't see you around."
Country'll grow."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
I'll bring back my lady."
And have it on Highway 61."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
I'll endow them onto thee."
We want folksingers here."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
And keep him good company."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
And hung on a willow tree."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
And pretend that you never have met."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
It's all for the love of thee."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"I've had too much of your company,"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
"Have you seen dignity?"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Will mourn for your return."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
And punched my cigarette."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
From across that lonesome ocean."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
But I know what you want."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Where you and I will unite."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
You and I'll never know."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"That way down Highway 61."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Has kindly assisted me home."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
We'll both go home together."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I would want again tomorrow."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget, now, you are white."
But we were tangled up in blue."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Would kill a little bird like me."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Tangled up in blue."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Poor boy never say die,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Where he got him a job on a fishing boat docked outside Delacroix,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
All day long I hear him shouting loud,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
And you make love just like a woman,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
The kingdoms of experience,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Nothing was delivered,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
You had enough of hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
And may you stay forever young,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Who could they get to carry you,
You can stick your head in the sand,
And make promises by the hours,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Someone to close his hear,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
I bless the day I found you,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Trust yourself,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
I went down to scrub and rub,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Read books, repeat quotations,
One by one until there were none,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
For his age he is wise,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
It's like I ain't here,
This world is ruled by violence,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
For all intended purposes,
First to come in was the flying moth,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
And, if I can save you any time,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
If you must cling to someone,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
That long, black train is pulling down,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Don't wanna be a bum,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Stand up straight and tall,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Give me the wings and I could fly,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
That fellow who never blushes,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
The one we can see and can feel,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Better jump down the manhole,
Using every angle under the sun,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
A dream about you, baby,
There's a ship and it sails on the sea,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Don't let me change my heart,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I had no one for to go my bail,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
It don't matter what you did,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Each one playing a horn,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Winter would have no spring,
Never needed to call you my whore,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
They--they show me to the door,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
If she ain't feeling well,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
I like the way that you move your hips,
And when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Better jump down a manhole,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
If anything is gonna sell,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Beating for the dead that rise,
I would not feel so all alone,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
That her father was going to hang,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
That five walls cannot hide him,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
To have--be on your own,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Stay away from the train line,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Corrina, Corrina,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Saved,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Well, I'm pressing on,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
And on the highway of regret,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Far away from it all,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Crumble into one another,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
To strict party-platform ties,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
I don't care if you feel like me,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
But, if you want me to,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Dust on my face and my cape,
But it would not be new,
I had a job in the Great North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Where I will always be renewed,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
The Second World War came to an end,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Without a love of my own,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Just like a rolling stone,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
And I--I walk out on my own,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Well, I don't mind dying,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
My love winks, she does not bother,
You have given everything to me,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Well, you take just like a woman,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
The path you've endured has been rough,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
And, if I see the day,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
She'll surely turn to white,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Serve somebody,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Ain't no going back,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
God knows there's a heaven,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
God knows it's a crime,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Baby, please stop crying,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
They took a clean-cut kid,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Puffing on a big cigar,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
And point away from the past,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Get back, write Braille,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Three angels up above the street,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
And you fake just like a woman,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Whether you are right or wrong,
That lover, who just walked out your door,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
I try my best to be just like I am,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Come all without, come all within,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
Don't think twice, it's alright,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
To a solid rock,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
May you stay forever young,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
If you'd see me this way,
Don't let her see that you need her,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Vanished from my hand,
Well, I was looking everywhere for them god-darned Reds,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Till he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
A complete unknown,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Up and down the block,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Seem like I been down this way before,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Got my mind made up,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Mixing up the medicine,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I just keep pressing on,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
As human gods aim for their mark,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
You want watered-down love,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
To know how much I really care,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
I went out last night to take a little round,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
And I'm in the shade,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
All that and more and then some,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
On this new morning, new morning,
Simplify you, classify you,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
I shall be released,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I could have left this town by noon,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
For her to arrive,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Well, there ain't no going back,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
She would have married me,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Without a dream in my heart,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
High water rising, rising night and day,
At ships with tattooed sails,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
And your streets are getting empty,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Look out, kid,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
While paupers change possessions,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
You have given me eyes to see,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
The human mind can only stand so much,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
I got no place left to turn,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
We wanna put his ass in stir,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
God knows it's terrifying,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Baby, let me follow you down,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
I want you so bad,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Too noble to neglect,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
The night blows cold and rainy,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Want you,
Pick you up every time you fall,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
With the juice running down my leg,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
They say every distance is not near,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
The country doctor rambles,
My existence led by confusion boats,
And it's only that I'm asking,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
While riding on a train going west,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
A true love of mine,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
When there is no more,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Six months on the chain gang,
Looking 'bout the government,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Each time we meet, love,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Or select you or dissect you,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Is used, it is plain,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Someone to open each and every door,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
No, nothing was delivered,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
The air is getting hotter,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Ever since I been a child,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Aim well, my little one,
Too serious to fool,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Oh, Angelina,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Get born, keep warm,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
It was you who came right through,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
And furnish me with tape,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
He's young and on fire,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
And it ain't me, babe,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
And I'm so glad,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Equality, liberty,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Don't let her see where you're going,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
We take great delight in our own company,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
God knows it's a struggle,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Oh, see what you can do,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
And I'm back in the rain,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
In the little church a-this side of tow,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
You need something to open your eyes,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
When the night comes falling,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Mama, wipe the blood off of my face,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Sara, Sara, wherever we travel, we're never apart,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
You stole her love from me one day,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
In the darkness of my night,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
And think they're fooling you,
I fell down to my bended knees,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
I once held her in my arms,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Someone to close his heart,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
A hand set the spark,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Then they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Paradise, sacrifice,
My hands didn't touch him none,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
In the great unknown,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
If I didn't have to guess,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
By losers, cheaters,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
We'll fly the night away,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Private reasons, great or small,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
When God and man will be reconciled,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Some are mathematicians, some are truck drivers' wives,
They say that every man must fall,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
When she lays upon the grass,
Precious angel under the sun,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Thinking about the government,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
They say everything can be replaced,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Circled by the circus sands,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
But, if I can save you any time,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Can't find what I need,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
If you can't quit your sinning,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
And don't criticize what you can't understand,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Don't matter what you did,
Carved next to his name,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
I should have left this town this morning,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Here come the story of the "Hurricane",
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Well, I quit my job so I could work alone,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Since you've been gone,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
She's opened up a happy home,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Wintertime in New York town,
It's really something,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Resent him to the bone,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
How does it feel,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
But it ain't him to blame,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Silvio, I gotta go,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
You've got to serve somebody,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
And also by his feet,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
God knows there's a chance,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
They say every man must fall,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Mercury, gravity,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Laying low,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
God knows there's a purpose,
There's always someone who understands,
The wind howls like a hammer,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
But, to remain as friends,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
On the stone that remains,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
I can see the turning of the key,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Like a dog on a chain,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
You and me, we had completeness,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
To be--direction home,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
I got my mind made up,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
They say every man needs protection,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I'd already gone the distance,
Eh, see what you can do,
In the lonely night,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Far away in the stormy night,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
And joined the John Birch Society,
I thank the Lord,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Already the fiesta has begun,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
One by one they followed the sun,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Till both of us fell by the way,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
God knows there's a river,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Make promises by the hours,
It's rising up above my head,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
I'm going out of my mind,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Dream about you, baby,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
I never can go because, you know,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
To be without a home,
Keep a clean nose,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
That must be what it's all about,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
The man in the trench-coat,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Went back home to the yard,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
And the whole world is on your case,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Heart of mine,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Just don't know what to do,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
He is centuries old,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Make promises by the hour,
Carry the New York Times,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Just like I did before,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
It's too bad he had to go,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
To be alone with you,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
But something has changed,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
But he can't be blamed,
Don't let yourself fall,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
When all will be well,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
But you were gambling for support,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
But, deep inside my heart,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
So now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
And it's like I ain't here,
Makes no difference where she's been,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
When he drifted down to LA where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I got the worried blues,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Take the motherless children off the street,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Thank You, Lord,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
She'll be coming forth,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Tell her not to worry,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
In his anger and his shame,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Keep me where you are,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Heart of mine, be still,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Looking for a new fool,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
They say every man must need protection,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
They must bust in early May,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I wish tonight were here,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
If not for you,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
I've been saved - well, alright,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Don't try No Doz,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Had no one to go my bail,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
In the turning of twilight,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
All the silver, all the gold,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
To be on your own,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
The winter would hold no spring,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
And not going through any great extreme,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
I leaned my back up against an oak,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
He got that soft, silky skin,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
And the sooner you come up with them,
He had a job in the old North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
It still ain't me, babe,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Father of black, father of white,
I been good,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
God knows that, when you see it,
Don't wear sandals,
Go away from my window,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
I went into the city, into the town,
Don't let her see,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Over your senses you have no control,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Make you spin or do you in,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
It's a price I have to pay,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
You broke a heart that loved you,
They run a brick and tile company,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
I had so much left to do,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Some speak of the future,
You don't want a love that's pure,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
And, although that we're single and free,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
And give him back the time he's done,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Watching the river flow,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Loaded deep as deep can be,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Front door shut, back door too,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I know I can't win,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Watered-down love,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
I'd only have to stay,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
You need something to open up a new door,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
And you know I could never be your own,
People going down to the ground,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Relationships of ownership,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
The country music station plays soft,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Tell me that you love me only,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
We've killed each one,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
God don't call it wrong,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Them Reds did it,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Look away, you rolling river,
That can do what's never been done,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Like a complete unknown,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
You have given all there is to give,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Roll, Willie, roll,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
You will be alright, girl,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
With no direction home,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
To hang and to lynch,
Let's hear the story of the "Hurricane",
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Face full of black soot,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
I got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Grandpa died last week,
Like as not, it's better so,
We live and we die, we know not why,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Of ancient history,
You better chew gum,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
I run right home and I went to bed,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Like some mystery,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
And there's two white horses following me,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
And here I sit so patiently,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I march in the parade of liberty,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
I'll be on my way,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
I just don't see why I should even care,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Well, I was sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
But it ain't me, babe,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Adios, mi corazon,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
A man with a badge skips by,
People are crazy, times are strange,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I threw it all away,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
That can do what's a-never been done,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Oxford Town around the bend,
If you throw it all away,
But ye shall be a-changed,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
All the tired horses in the sun,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Just to know that you are near,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Now, love is gentle, love is kind,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Joey, Joey,
Friends with you,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Hmm, I can make it through,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Tell me,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Drifting too far from shore,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
It all seemed so well-timed,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Who's never weak but always strong,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
We never much thought we could get very old,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
You don't have to feed me,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
How he died nobody can say,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
And to come every time you call,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
I love you, pretty baby,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Madams light the candles,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Don't know what to do without it,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Staying far behind without you,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
I couldn't imagine doing anything else,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Forever young, forever young,
We got you for that motel job. We were talking to your friend, Bello,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
You gotta look some other place,
I like the cool way you look at me,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Badge out, laid off,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
I'm never, never far from home,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Advertising signs, they con,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
To gather flowers constantly,
My limbs are shaking,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I want you,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
I just can't beg you anymore,
The night blows rainy,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
This situation can only get rougher,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
You made it there somehow,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
The Communists were coming around,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
All them prophets good and gone,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
You'll change your last name, too,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Is looking for a new fool,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
The night would see me wide awake,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
You got something I want plenty of,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
But now morning is clear,
To keep up his hate,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Father of night, father of day,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
There she come, now, down my way,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Oh, in somebody's room,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
As the present now will later be past,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
The beat is pumping,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
I can make it through,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Loyalty, unity,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I found my world, found my world in you,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
It's alright,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
To protect his white skin,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Heart of mine, go back home,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Who will promise never to part,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
She never does me wrong,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I'd be sad and blue,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Of this I can't say very much,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Well, I been gambling so long,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
She got great big hind legs,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
May be an actor in a plot,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Seven days,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
In the hills of mystery,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
By rivers of blindness,
Sara, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
The joint is jumping,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Read books and repeat quotations,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
God knows everything,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Holding his club like he was a king,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
The cloak-and-dagger dangles,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Thieving in the alley,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
And, if anybody asks me,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
She once was a true love of mine,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I looked way up my chimney-hole,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
He's not selling any alibis,
Judge and jury took their stand,
You follow, find yourself at war,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Father who taketh the darkness away,
At the close of the day,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
God knows it's fragile,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
You even make love just like a woman,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Searching high, searching low,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
I need someone to talk to and a new hiding place,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Saying over her shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
She said she would always stay,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Eh, singing just for you,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
And it still ain't me, babe,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
If ever I prove false to you,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
He had a job in Santa Fe working in an old hotel,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
You were snow, you were rain,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Strangers all give me the news,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
In the end,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
But I'm saved,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
True love of mine,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
China doll, alcohol,
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
She aches just like a woman,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Says he's got a bad bill,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
They say every man need protection,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
That's the story of the "Hurricane",
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
It was a girl I learned it from,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
God knows it's true,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
You married young just like your ma,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
In the ruins of your balcony,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Love don't have any place,
I don't want to meet your kin,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
So now I'm going back on again, I got to get to them somehow,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
That the laws are with him,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
When I seen him lose control,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
God knows you've got to weep,
It always means so much,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I got a wife and five little children,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Every brain is civilized,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Like you never did before,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
She leave by the other and roam,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
But the bottles are done,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
But I'm pressing on,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Precious memories, how they linger,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Stone you and say good luck,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
I just don't know what to do,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Looked behind the kitchen, behind the door,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Need a woman all the time,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Love that's pure no accident,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Over the hills and far away,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
"Not me," said his manager,
Try to be a success,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
From their fates try to resign,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
I need a shot of love,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Ooh, watered-down love,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Honey, just for you to climb,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
By the night and been to some place new,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
Like a rolling stone,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
God sees it all unfold,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
You got to serve somebody,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
I can change, I swear,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I've been in and out of happiness,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I get my sweet reward,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Tears on the letter that I write,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
People talk over situations,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Bring the wife and family,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I'm so glad,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I ain't looking to block you up,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
In the image of someone you used to know,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
One more night the stars are in sight,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
I've been all around the world, boys,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
So I drifted down to New Orleans where I lucky was to be employed,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Go melt back in the night,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Automobile coming into style,
Living in the land of Nod,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
I been riding the midnight train,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
The sky too is folding under you,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Memory, ecstasy,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
With his candle lit into the sun,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Don't let her hear,
The day would surely have to break,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Don't follow leaders,
I went into the city, went into the town,
In the instant that I preach,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Or have done something wrong,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Went back to my backyard,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
The sky too is folding over you,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
My love, she speaks softly,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Father of time and father of dreams,
You wanna drown love,
Broken lines, broken strings,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Gonna serve somebody,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
All you can do is do what you must,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
The day you quit me, baby,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Is it really any wonder,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
And rivers that ran through every day,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Going,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
God knows it's outta sight,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And I'm just like that bird,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
They tell me every man must fall,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Well, well, well,
God knows how to make it flow,
I got those worried blues,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
This place ain't doing me any good,
I have no one to meet,
And pretend that we never have touched,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
They pass by so silently,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Five by five they tried to survive,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
That you'd have liked me to,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
All I really wanna do,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
You were striped, you were plain,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
But I've been hanging on,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Alfred Bello laid this rap on the cops,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
My dear, sweet friend,
God knows when,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Just then the order came to charge,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
She said she would never forget,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
You can run down to the desert,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
But you try with your whole soul,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Enter Patty Valentine from the outer hall,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Icicles hanging down,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Without your sweet love,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Pressing on,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
And played the fife lowly,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
For something that he never done,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
He's the property of Jesus,
But I know that he don't talk,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Made of silver or of golden,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
People talk of situations,
My senses have been stripped,
I went down where the vultures feed,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I got me a secret membership card,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
You got something better,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
I been good while I been waiting,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
But evidently she don't,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Don't you tell Henry,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
He won't do nothing to you,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
And I got the worried blues,
I looked beneath the sofa, beneath the chair,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Give what I got until I got no more,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Says he's got a bad cough,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
And, though the line is cut,
I can't be good, baby,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
I'm leaving today,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
I just can't do what I've done before,
And when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
That fired the gun,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Three by three they're turning the key,
So, never leave me lonely,
But you're doing it again,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
May be living in another country under another name,
People carry roses,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
I got a bird that whistles,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Well, get sick, get well,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
I'm going down the river,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Rabbit running down across the road,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
And gathering storms may arise,
They lowered him down as a king,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
You could look at it and weep,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
I can hear Him calling for my soul,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
With his fist in a clinch,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
To find out if she's talked,
She takes just like a woman,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Well, I may just swear,
With what your fate is going to be,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
But the time ain't tall,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
The light I never knowed,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
Oh, singing just for you,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Try hard, get barred,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
In the shadows of moonlight,
But he never did like it all that much and one day it just a-went to hell,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
The only son of God Almighty,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Never did feel this way before,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
A handle hid out in the dark,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
Honey, I will meet you there,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
It always has hit me from below,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Father of air and father of trees,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Got me a secret membership card,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Someone who will die for you and more,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Don't ever try to change me,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
And she aches just like a woman,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
We live in a political world,
More people kept a-piling on,
Though they could not produce the gun,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
I just say no thanks,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Go down to the river, babe,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
As the daylight hours do increase,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
"Come along and take a trip,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And every cause that ever I fought,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Day you quit me, baby,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
It could even be like a myth,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
You're beautiful to me,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Going, going,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Said I'm pressing on,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Don't tie no bows,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Broken threads, broken springs,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Every moon is so sanctified,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Waiting for the trains,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Precious father, loving mother,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Searching everywhere I know,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
My arms and legs were broken,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Get dressed, get blessed,
My love, she speaks like silence,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
But all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
No direction home,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Well, I can't understand,
Oh, watered-down love,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
To be out on your own,
The night passed away so quickly,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
True love, they've been without it,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Newspapermen eating candy,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Early one morning the sun was shining, she was lying in bed,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
I try my best to be like I am,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
You can raise up your right hand,
Under the microscope,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
So glad,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Well, the job that you used to have,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
It was from her ship sailing,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Cares not to come up any higher,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
In one the surface was frozen,
So now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
My woman needs it every day,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
I've been around this whole country,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Yet every distance is not near,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Their folks, they said their lives together sure was a-gonna be rough,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
I think we better talk this over,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
A worried man with a worried mind,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
See you fly or watch you die,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
For the politician's gain,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Father of day, father of night,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
In a pine box for all eternity,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Baby, thank you for my tea,
If'n you don't know by now,
Nothing too very scientific,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Well, I was feeling sad and kind of blue,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Something about you that I can't shake,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Look who's back in town,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
And you take just like a woman,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Light yourself a candle,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Gay as a jewel when first it’s new,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
I can't understand,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Don't let her know,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Don't let me drift too far,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Far away and over the wall,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
You to me were true,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
I long to see you in the morning light,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, I'm so glad,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
How he died nobody could say,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
I rambled out of New York town,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And come every time you call,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Yes, I want you so bad,
A million faces at my feet,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Speaking to some French girl,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
To be one your own,
They keep it all hid,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Just as long as you stay with me,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Going home,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
To shine in through,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Ah, get sick, get well,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Going, going, gone,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
First degree and second degree,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
To stay closer than any friend,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
They don't believe in mercy,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Thinking it was a trusty tree,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
God don't call it treason,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
As his youth now unfolds,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Stripping away at it all,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Rubin Carter was a-falsely tried,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
I want my arms around you,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
And I got those worried blues,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Watch the river flow,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
So unknown,
And, on their promises of paradise,
The haunted, frightened trees,
And she'll be coming forth,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
So I got those worries blues,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Out to the windy beach,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
But she takes just like a woman,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
Never weak but always strong,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
You have explained every mystery,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
But I would not feel so all alone,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
They were in the air, they were on the ground,
By users, cheaters,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Father who build the mountain so high,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
You have given me life to live,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
My woman's never sitting at home,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
The wind blowing the snow around,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
New morning,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
A thousand miles from home,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
God knows you ain't pretty,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Made before the foundation of the world,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Trouble,
Now you don't talk so loud,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Into my own parade,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
When I was in Missouri,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
So he drifted down to New Orleans, lucky not to be destroyed,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Not the end, not the end,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Hang around the ink-well,
Pistol-shots ring out on a barroom night,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Every head is so dignified,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
"Not I," said the referee,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
A question in your nerves is lit,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
To be so useless and all,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
But, if I will save you the time,
Mama, I can hear that thunder roar,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Give you my money, honey,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Two by two they step in the dark,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
I got to know, babe, if it's you I'm wanting,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Come on, come on, stick together,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
The only thing I knew how to do was keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Hazel, you called and I came,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Want you so bad,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
And the point is slick,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
You came down on me like white thunder,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I got two white horses following me,
To your tambourine in time,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Without ideals or violence,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
One by one they follow the sun,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
To hide 'neath a hood,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
For she ain't the same,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
They walk among the stately trees,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Why she did go,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Ye shall be changed,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Well, the way I love that woman,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
And when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Ye shall be a-changed,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
And to come each time you call,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
It hurts me, too,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
With a killer's pride, security,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
The battle outside is raging,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Somewhere down the road some day,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
In love and with kindness,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
He been around the world and back again,
I won't have my nature way,
Where life and death are memorized,
And the night blows rainy,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
For the wise men and the fools,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
And forget my pride,
Ten thousand miles or more -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
Thank--
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
How badly they were shocked -
Havanagee-luh-
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Oh, my-
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
I long to hold you in the night -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
I a-hope you can hear--
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
First degree and second degree -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
They crammed me back into the county jail -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
I hope that you can hear--
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
Remember me to one who lives there -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
Haven't seen her since that night -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Hava-na-
Havana-gee-
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Ha-va-
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
Turn, turn, turn again -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Private reasons - great or small -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
To know where you are -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
Let me know, babe, that--will you surround me? -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
Hang out the whole next day -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
With notions his canoe was laden -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
It can't be this way everywhere -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
With no other choice except but for to go -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
I'm sure it was not three -
That's where you belong --
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
Whispering your secret emotion -
You will not hear a laugh -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Democracy don't rule the world --
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
Disconnect these cables--
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
That can win what's a-never been won -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Leave all the children home -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
Indians camp along her border -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
I got no idea what I want -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
When it's over, I'd just as soon go on my way"--
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
As suicide remarks are torn -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
So I can know if I'm really real.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
She just acts like we never have met.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
When she's better only time'll tell.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Can't see over to the other side.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Come on, darling.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away - we're gonna forget it.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Valentines can't buy her.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
Or put up against the wall.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
And try to avoid the scandals.
I used to care, but things have changed.
You can say I didn't give to you.
You have no idea what you do to me.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
You were always so close and still within reach.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Tangled up in blue.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
For the times, they are a-changing.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Even tore loose the kitchen floor.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
I had something to protect.
Even deep down inside my toilet bowl.
There were six thousand people there.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Go lightly on the ground.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
That's really and truly an American.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Suffering like a fool.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
She murdered mortal he.
And you did it with strength that belonged to the gods.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
If you won't come out your window.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
It was a normal day.
That keep us so tightly bound.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
When you go your way and I go mine.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Some place so high above this wall.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
The whole night through.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
When you made everybody pay.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a-a diamond as big as your shoe.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Life don't mean a thing.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I--but I just don't know how.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
Who says she knows me well.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
The next day could be your last.
Drifting too far from shore.
God knows...
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
I remember her whispering yet.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
It ain't quite the end.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
From my toes up to my ears.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
It was you who understood.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Baby, baby.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Went into the laundry to wash my clothes down.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.

Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
To the old folks' home and the college.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
They both rode off together.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
I don't believe you.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
Ten by ten they drank it again.

In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.

She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
The same as my father before him.
All because his face was brown.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
And the pearls are from Japan.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Love my Blackjack Davey.

But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.

Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
That Johanna's not here.
You don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
I know you always say that you agree.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
She can't find him anywhere.
If it just don't make me hurts.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
I threw it all away.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bow have fallen from her curls.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
I'm not the one you need.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
She once was a true love of mine.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
And each one I've never seen again.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Turned on my record player.
I seen a man.
My baby took my heart from me.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Memories of what used to be.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Thanks.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
It was raining from the first and I was a-dying out there of thirst so I came in here.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
I hope I'm ready.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
When I run outta things to investigate.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Thanks for coming. We'll be in the area for a few days. Maybe we'll see you tomorrow at 9.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
I'd like to know.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
I needed somebody to talk to.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
And the people that confronted him were many.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
Just what this song is all about.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
And relive my dreams.
Without a love of my own.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Calling out that he's been framed.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
I never saw the man again.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Never been so easy or so slow.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
And I'll rock you too.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Walking around with no one else.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Must be and that is all.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
You don't have to worry any more.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
You're the only love I've ever known.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Heart of mine.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Thought I was a communist.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
With the golden loom.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Rain would gather too.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
I know they're not what they seem.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
My face you'll never see no more.
That I left in the French Quarter.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
And both shall row, my love and I.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
After losing every battle.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
I always thought that he was well.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Who always was too proud to beg.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
If'n you don't know by now.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
That's the way I remember her best.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
And I need you, ah.
Your old road is rapidly fading.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
Trouble...
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
There's no words that need to be said.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
I'm just average, common too.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Where you fought for my soul and made up against the odds.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Kisses she gave him three.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
I hope you're ready.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
Most of the time.
Mine alone.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Gone as the season she's taken.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Come on, baby...
And the sails are spread.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
To hold me in your arms.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
The light I never knowed.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Join the army if you fail.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
Last radio is playing.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.
You know the song in my heart.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
I just can't keep from crying.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
This song is called "Hurricane". If you got any political pull at all, maybe you can help us get this man outta jail, back onto the streets.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Saying wants company.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
What's real and what is not.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Nothing done and nothing said.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Crying out that he been framed.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Step lightly on the ground.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
On the caboose of the train.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Evidently she won't.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
To anything I mighta tried.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
And it never seemed strange.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
I don't know.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
I'd give anything to be with you.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
I can't fight them anymore.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
You know, I loved her just the same.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.

And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.

My heart is telling me I love you still.

Nobody stops to ask why.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.

Honey, baby.
The National Guard stands around the door.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

I finally got a job in New York town.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
And say you'll always let it be me.

What looks like the easy way out.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.

Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
You can make it too.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.

The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.

But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
Tell me.
Just like so many times before.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
A true love of mine.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.

Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
And she'll only know he's dead.

Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.

That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Baby, baby...
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Find out something only dead men know.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
People sleeping in broken beds.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
But he sure left here in style.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
Hope you're ready.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
To live it you had to explode.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
You're a big girl all the way.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Because everybody must get stoned.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
I know the kinds of things you like.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
But I ain't neither one.
For the saving grace that's over me.
That old ship was a-going down.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
You're my honey.
Till she sees finally she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Till your error you clearly learn.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Rode slowly back again.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
While I'm in the hall.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Baby, two feet from the well.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Hmm.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
And they gotta cut something.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
I will only let you down.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
"And stay all night with me.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
And you even make love just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
For the times, they-they are a-changing.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
Take me as I am or let me go.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Or inspect you or reject you.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
And the Santa Fe.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Tried to create a next world war.
To which a scoundrel clings.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
At the end of the trail.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Mortality, reality.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
Figuring a way to get back home.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
You may not see me tomorrow.
The sooner you can leave.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
And crime don't have a face.
Friends with you.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
Finalize you or advertise you.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Is just equality in school.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
Your loyalty is a-not to me but to the stars above.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
I took some comfort there.
They want me for a gambling fight.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
At my window with a broken wing.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Leading me, going home.
Wasn't any difference to me.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Hmm, tell me.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
She's in some foreign land.
Waiting on my burying ground.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Chain you down or be your clown.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
The whole world is my throne.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
And you only got ten.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
If you just let me follow you down.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
It only brings me sorrow.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
People bending broken rules.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And another man named Bello, moving mysteriously.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Unless they're from another world.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
That's the day you die.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Buildings going up to the sky.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
You cast your spell and I went under.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
It's just the same as talking to you.
I followed the winding stream.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Need that woman straight and true.
I know something is changed.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
As the present now will later be past.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
And fades away like some morning dew.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
I find it so difficult to leave.
But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Four by four they turn it some more.
For that's the way I remember her best.
Adios, mi corazon.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
And no time to think.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Put me outta doors.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
And laid his life on the line.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
You'd better get that in your head.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
And he was a friend of mine.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
He never did know what it was all about.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
I got nothing left to burn.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
You're on the bottom.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Honey, I want you.
And every window made of glass.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Everything is broken.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
To the sin of love's false security.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Going through all these things twice.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
My mind is breaking.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Greenwich Village.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I couldn't find any.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
The place that I started from.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
I can't shoot them anymore.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Billy, you been running for so long.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
That brave and devoted band.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here-it's, uh-have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd-I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
To reach of your rattling drums.
A man named Martin Luther King...
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Broken voices on broken phones.
When I'm alone with you.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
I only saw what they let me see.
Have fallen from her curls.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
And clouds cover up the ground.
At not getting their money's worth.
Precious memories flood my soul.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Duality, mortality.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Lord, protect my child.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Don't say I never warned you if your train gets lost.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
For as long as love will last.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
If not for you.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Just like you've always smiled before.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Police at your back.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Your voice was all that I heard.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
And the mailbox is locked.
You break your promise all over the place.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Until I threw it all away.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Look a-the other way.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
And I'll go last.
The water is wide and I can’t cross over.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
And one day he came passing by.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I'm falling in love with you.
It'll never do, somehow.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
And she makes love just like a woman, and she breaks just like a little girl.
We all know for sure that it's real.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
But I ain't got Corrina.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.

You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Sound like it's on a final run.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
But mine was a little different, you see.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Sara, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.
Sara, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
Thank y'all.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
Some place so high above the wall.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
He's the neighborhood bully.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
And all I see are dark eyes.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
I can't fire them anymore.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
The time and the place that we'd part.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
He could die happily ever after.
Under the hedges.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
And gives it to me for a song.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
You got it, baby.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Bid farewell forever.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Everybody that was hanging out.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
Just Like a Woman? Alright, we'll -- we'll try it.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Said it was a bad dream.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Trust yourself.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Humility, simplicity.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
They would not let me be.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Down along my restless palms.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
And discovered her invisible self.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Never will want for money.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
See like me or be like me.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
You won't get it for money.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Headed out for the western skies.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Just crying out that he was framed.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Is gonna be against the law.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Looking for a new friend.
But you're not even sure what it is.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Right now I'm having trouble.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
'Neath the rose bush.
Even the softest touch.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Far down the street we stray.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
Is what this thing here is for.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
But, baby, please stop crying--it's tearing up my mind.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
And your highway's getting filled.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Baby, let me follow you down.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Food was flying everywhere - I left without my hat.
And all your raging glory.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
I'll only let you down.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
I just go pump on it some.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
But my heart just won't give in.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
In the palace of the Pope.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Foundationed deep somehow.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
Baby, please come home.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
I'm going where I never been before.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Than people who are most content.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
It would go up against every rule.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
But simply because it's true.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Take it on down to give me grow.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Using ideas as my maps.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Or define you or confine you.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Hope I don't blow it.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Mama, you are on my mind.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
That last night I was with.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
And you must realize the danger.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
All the faces we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
There's man who swears he's not to blame.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
Bring that bottle over here.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Yeah, here's one for ya.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
In my Cadillac.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
I've made shoes for everyone - even you - while I still go barefoot.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
Ever since I seen you there.
I feel like I'm looking at a-heaven's door.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
They're all gonna take on down by the bounded bank.
I got trouble in my mind.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
But these to tell what's true.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
I would only let you down.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's a-time for us to quit.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
I'll hold it down for you.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Ever since we've been apart.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
"Don't trill no news on me.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Chain you down or bring you down.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I didn't feel so cold then.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
And shot it fulla holes.
Even before you came in the door.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
And it is time for me to slide.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
Living down Sonora way.
Fighting every inch of the way.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
But I was raised on the other.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
You're my baby.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
But you were tangled up in blue.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Under the midnight moon.

In the dark land of the sun.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Alright, thank you.
Good as I been to you.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
That must be what it's all about.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
But the mountains of the past.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
And that failure's no success at all.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Six by six...
Reality has always had too many heads.
Lay your hand upon my head.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Went into a laundry to wash my clothes down.
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for the pay.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
If you throw it all away.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Honey, I never would have come.
You are on the bottom.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Just what he was talking about.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
Lay dead beside him there.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
And you--you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
And I was brought up by my brother.
In this concrete world full of souls.
I think this time we should escape.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
And guarded them as they fell.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
I scarcely feel the glow.
Until my dying-day.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Slowly into autumn.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
In the night the price was paid.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
In the brightness of my day.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
They seem determined to go all the way.
It's just the old American way.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
In the border-towns of despair.
Going, going, gone.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Throw my ticket in the wind.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
And ye shall be changed.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
The words that her lover had said.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
Of every man who put me here.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Tell me that it isn't true.
And then unto eternity.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
With my suitcase in my hand.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Crying out that he was framed.
I did not do it knowingly.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Oh, Angelina.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
It sure is right on a night like this.
His voice, it trembles as he's calling out for another plate of food.
68, but says he's 24.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
I don't know any more than this.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Down to New Orleans.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Tomorrow will be another day.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Gal, you're on my mind.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
To know which way the wind blows.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
With all these promises you left for me.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Till I come into New York town:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
His epitaph plain:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
But there's one promise, darling:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
In Paterson, that's the way things go:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Yeah, serve somebody:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
About everybody that was hanging out;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
All lies and jest;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
So many things that we never will undo;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Had to be held down by big police;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
I find complete love;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
How's everything in heaven?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Before you call him a man?
How could they let you go?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Gal, where you been so long?
Why would I want to take your life?
Of everything you see?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Where did you hide your halo?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
By golly, what more can I say?
Before he can see the sky?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
How many more can they afford?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
What else can a poor boy do?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Are you the same person that was here before?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Have they missed you?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
How many compared to yesterday?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
That too many people have died?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Like a rolling stone?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Don't you remember making baby love?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
How much poison did they inhale?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Too many people have died?
Has anybody seen my love?
Are you ready?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
How many more without any reward?
And one deserving of affection?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Poor boy, where you been?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
What do you think about that, my friend?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
But am I still dreaming yet?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
What's wrong with you this time?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's chasing after me?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
How can I live for You?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Why and what's the reason for?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before it's washed to the sea?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
When did you leave heaven?
Am I ready?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Did you respect me for what I did?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Did you know about Betty Ross?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Before it is washed to the sea?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Don't the moon look good, honey, shining through the trees?
Baby, can't you tell?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Can you get back in?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Where did you lose your wings?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
What would life be?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What can I do for You?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Who cares?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Before he can hear people cry?
What good am I?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
What?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
To love and follow His direction?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Across the swooping plain?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
When he's standing in front of you?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
What can I give to You?
How could they ever mistake you?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Just like a rolling stone?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
For all these earthly things?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Before they're forever banned?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Can I come home with you?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
How does it feel?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
And how does it feel?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
But who did I see but the one I love?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Ready, George?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Crime was murder one and guess who testified?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Don't the brakeman look good, baby, flagging down the Double E?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Does anyone even try?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Must everybody bow?
Oh, so why not you and me?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Across the swamp of time?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
Well, the dog collar's from India
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Standing on the water, casting your bread
But love grows old and waxes cold
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
But something has changed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
I want you, baby, just to understand
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
And that even the nobles get properly handled
She let go of my hand
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Many times I've often prayed
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
To see him obviously framed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
I run right home and I went to bed
We live in a political world
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
You used--be so proud
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
And your trouble is you know it too good
I've been walking around
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
There ain't nothing in this world
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Now, whenever I get up and
Then came the warning that was before the flood
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
While some, on principles baptized
Just what you had in mind
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I will not go down under the ground
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
But she ain't gonna find the road
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
He wagged his tail and shook his head
--Arthur Dexter Bradley and Bello and they both lied
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
I live in another world
Now you don't seem so proud
And things would be different the next time we wed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
All the sweethearts you can hold
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Maybe someday you will understand
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Silvio, silver and gold
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Roving gambler, he was very bored
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
But now something has changed
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
You used to be so amused
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
It's something you did
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
And those whom doom and death had spared
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
They took a clean-cut kid
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Now you don't act so--so proud
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Either from the mountains of Madrid
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Nothing was delivered
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
And then you told me later as I apologized
Now, a very great man once said
Things would be different the next time we wed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
How many times can a man turn his head
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
For what you sold that's not been received
So I'll make my stand
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Nobody has to guess that a-baby can't be blessed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
"Equality". I spoke the word
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Somebody seen him hanging around
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Everything stays down where it's wounded
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Its iron claws attached
By no special friend
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
As I stand upon the sand
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And into the path you are hurled
I'll always thank the Lord
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
I thought that it was well-understood
He was a clean-cut kid
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
And I'm just the same as anyone else
You into thinking you're the one
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
When Reilly's daughter got a message
I've been wondering all about me
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
A bed that is never mine
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
So I look like a walking mountain range
From the start by the rule
I'm ready for to fade
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
But the dark does die
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
The man the authorities came to blame
It's getting dark, too dark to see
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Full of hope and desire
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
And you see why it's so unique to be
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
And her silver-studded phantom cause
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
See the primitive wallflower freeze
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Well, it's all new to me
"It's only you that he does crave
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
"Oh, father, you will surely die
She been gone
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Should I leave them by your gate
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
So, I called up the operator of time
Better stay away from those
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Though its shadow's metal badge
I can survive and I can endure
From all the plans they do pursue
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
And plenty time for good romance
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
From the Golden Gate Bridge
You say you're looking for someone
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
At dawn my lover comes to me
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
She plunged him into well water where
I don't even notice she gone
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
There were times when I was so lonesome
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Taking care of somebody nice
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Remember me to one who lives there
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
You're not free to belong to me
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Most of the time I can't even be sure
And I ain't complaining none
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
That she's the same one
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Mona tried to tell me
They say don't come back no more
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
If dogs run free, then what must be
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Limited in sex they dare
I been wondering all about me
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
To show you something you seen before
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
We see this empty cage now corrode
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
The cause was there before we came
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Feel to moan, but unlike before
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
And I would send a message
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
But the first it bent and then it broke
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
How was I to know you'd be the one
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
What good am I then to others and me
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
You know, it's not even safe no more
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
You cut to the core
What you're gonna say when you get home
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Up into some paradise
You just pick anyone
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
It's all new to me
Should I put them by your gate
What's probably got you baffled more
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
If dogs run free, why not me
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
With all memory and fate
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
And suddenly there appeared before me
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And never sat once at the head of the table
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Says it's closing time
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
You said you'd never compromise
I do declare
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Just pick anyone
Waiting to find out what price
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
If dogs run free, why not we
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
So I remember every face
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Maybe someday you will look back and see
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
It'll be with me unto the grave
How many ears must one man have
Remember me to the one who lives there
When I'm all alone
Well, six white horses that you did promise
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
He'll see by his grave
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Little did I realize
When the rain is blowing in your face
Among the lovely people living free
While them that defend what they cannot see
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
But it won't be over till they clear his name
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
But I feel nothing for their game
Leaving men wholly, totally free
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
To give the special one you seek a chance
But I can get another one
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
I rode with him in a taxi once
Lies that life is black-and-white
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
You smiling through the fence at me
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Just what you will say when you get home
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
So up she picked her babies three
As he rises to fame
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
And the Negro's name
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
I peeked behind the picture frame
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
When the roses fade
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
I am homeless, come and take me
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
The crashing waves roll over me
She knows there's no success like failure
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Hunger pays a heavy price
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Knows there's no success like failure
And that is that one must always flush out his house
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
What about that millionaire
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Con you into thinking that you're the one
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
On the rising curve
All I feel is heat and flame
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
But I can't say I sympathize
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
The order is a-rapidly fading
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
For your weary toes to be a-touching
It's not a bad way to make a living
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
The order is rapidly fading
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
For your weary toes to be touching
I know that you know that I know that you show something
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Beyond here lies nothing
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Where the time and the tempo drag
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Deceived me into thinking
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
If I was with her too long
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
She rode by night and came by morning
The battle outside raging
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
But then a whistle will be blowing
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
They're drinking up and walking
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And there's no telling who that it's naming
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
'Cause the battle outside raging
There's nothing in here moving
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
I have fallen far beneath
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Then she told us how times were tough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And how I know I'll make it through
Look out, the saints are coming through
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Girls' faces formed the forward path
You go north and you go south
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Her voice once and talk
Well, there ain't no going back
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
I wish she'd unlock
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Shoot in the back
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
The man in me will do nearly any task
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Make everything from toy guns that spark
But they caught him and they brought him back
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
You turn around to take a final peek
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
I chased me a woman up the hill
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
A girl by the whirlpool
How many seas must a white dove sail
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Well, if I die on top of the hill
How does it feel
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
They ask me how I feel
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Soul to soul our shadows roll
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Yeah, but if I die on top of the hill
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
And if my love is real
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
All and all can only fall
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
He's sure got a lot of gall
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Ring bar, hard to tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
A-how does it feel
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
He's taught in his school
Then why don't she tell
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
As the last fire-truck from hell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Oh, how does it feel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
How many seas must the white dove sail
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
"For you cannot relive them
So, one morning when the sun was warm
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You better not chew gum
Now, they asked me to read a poem
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
But I can hear another drum
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Two eyes took the aim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
And remain as I am
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Advertising signs that con
But the second mother was with the seventh son
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Somebody new to beat on
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
In ceremonies of the horsemen
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
And you ache a-just like a woman
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Must meet the dawn
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
I'll be waiting at the station
Uncle Rat went running downtown
The next morning she had awoken
I don't even care if I ever see her again
How many roads must a man walk down
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
But I swear I see my reflection
Well, you fake just like a woman
But it's hard to think on
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
You need something to make it known
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
You don't need a weatherman
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Please don't let on that you knew me when
A-she takes just like a woman
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
The ones that jump on the wagon
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Why did you trade heaven
She said that all the railroad men
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
She takes just like a woman
My love, she's like some raven
How can the life of such a man
All lay down their bandanas and complain
But the post office has been stolen
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
But me, I expected it to happen
He got that fortress on the mountain
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
She got such a sweet disposition
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
And she aches just like a woman
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Nothing we can call our own
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
There was little to say, there was no conversation
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Yes, and someone must explain
To remember the times when I was your only man
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
In the pigpen
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
As you sit on the box you keep him in
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
And all their daughters put me down
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Have died in battle or in vain
You take just like a woman
Poor boy in a red-hot town
That long, black train is pulling down
And the corner sign
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
The foreign sun, it squints upon
And she wakes just like a woman
As they rode him in custody down to the station
For the loser now will be later to win
Trying to get a lead on
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
And there's no exit in any direction
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
I figure maybe we're even
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Out of the shower comes a football man
That long, black train is pulling on down
All their daughters put me down
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Guns and clubs followed him down
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Darkness at the break of noon
From heights that they could not gain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
For the loser now might be later to win
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Their religion of the little ten women
But all their daughters put me down
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
"Not me," said the gambling man
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Well, I'm hanging on
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
To my knowledge there's just one man
But the second mom was with the seventh son
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Every place I wanna go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Silvio, I gotta go
Build me a boat that can carry two
There's nothing you can say or do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
There is a place you go
All I really wanna do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
All I'd like you to do
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
How many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
The man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
What good am I while you softly weep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Man in the coon-skin cap
Aladdin and his lamp
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
The wind howls like a hammer
I could feel a whole lot better
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
When you whispered in my ear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Alone you stand with nobody near
Still I've always kind of missed her
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
And I don't even think about her
The water is wide and I can’t cross over
But morning is clear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I don't have to go far
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
My ship is in the harbor
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
For I am married to a house carpenter
I say, "Why you say that for
The lover who has just walked out your door
Never no more do I wonder
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I close my eyes and I wonder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Who came here from Cuba's door
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
In one I was running and in another
At any moment you could go under
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
For all eternity I think I will remember
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
All you boys better run for cover
So, don't fear if you hear
You heard me saying a prayer for
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
The face of God will appear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
When only you are near
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Still I say her love-words over
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
He's not selling any alibis
Now, you must provide some answers
At times I think there are no words
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
They whisper in the wings
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
We living in times when men commit crimes
Glide across the lonely years
Well, the ragman draws circles
I'm gonna let you pass
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Thinking of a series of dreams
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And your father, to your sister he explains
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Don't wear sandals
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
And the poor white remains
True love can make a blade of grass
Good and bad, I define these terms
And then complains
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I'd gladly confess
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
And I try to harmonize with songs
Seven days
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Her window's wide open, African trees
But, though the masters make the rules
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
And so Patty calls the cops
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Six-time losers
To the cutting of fences
Romantic facts of musketeers
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
You know that he has no intentions
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And inside it with the people made of molasses
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
You should be made to wear earphones
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Wants eleven dollar bills
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You never turned around to see the frowns
As friends and other strangers
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
What good am I if I say foolish things
With a fantastic collection of stamps
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I was thinking of a series of dreams
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
With a big bouquet of the roses
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
The cowboy angel rides
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And tells me of her dreams
But still remains
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Six-time users
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
People on the platforms
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You been hurt so many times
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
People carry roses
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
To sharpen the senses
Don't follow leaders
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And, though the masters make the rules
Girl by the whirlpool's
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
You can fall down on your knees
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
In the dimestores and bus-stations
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And the princess and the prince discuss
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
I try to tell it like it is
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Statues made of matchsticks
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
To memorizing politics
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
That it's you and no one else that owns
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
That might be all that you got
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Every new messenger bringing evil report
There's some people that
He really wasn't where it's at
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
How many years can a mountain exist
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Wait for the morning light
They tell me revenge is sweet
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Like a corkscrew to my heart
You're hearing my heart beat
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I soon get some rest
He built a fire on Main Street
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
How many years can some people exist
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Ain't it hard when you discover that
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Someday, everything is gonna be different
The slow one now will later be fast
Our Father would not like the way that you act
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
And the first one now will later be last
Without any doubt
Well, early in the morning till late at night
With your pockets well protected at last
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
The slowest now will later be fast
Johnny's in the basement
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
By the way, that's a cute hat
You don't forget
But, then again, there's only one I've met
The slowest one now will later be fast
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
And, since my feet are now fast
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Keep it in your mind and not forget
I got into the driver's seat
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Everyone still talks about
She seems too far out
I'm moving after midnight
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Everything is always right
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
You used to laugh about
We can hold up a toast if we meet
But, if the arrow is straight
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
I think that it's best
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
You used to laugh-make fun about
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Plants in the bed, but
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
And I, in my armor, turning about
To hold each other tight
You're gonna get hit
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
So he never thinks straight
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
It don't take too long to find out
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
One more night the moon is shining bright
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
In the stillness of the midnight
You are there in the flickering light
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
I'm on the pavement
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Keep me set apart
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
They tell me to be discreet
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Talking that the heat put
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
I was too young to know you were doing it right
In the precious winds they rot
One more night I will wait for the light
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I can be just like you
To be alone with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I just might have to come see you
To protect you and defend you
And I tell this truth to you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Down every street there's a window
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
I seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
It only goes to show
Now, you're probably wondering by now
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
He seen a lot of women but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Don't it always go to show
But sooner or later one of us must know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Well, I'd sure like to know
He been living there three years now
The only one I know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Don't it always a-go to show
Sooner or later one of us must know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
So I ran down most hurriedly
She knocked upon it anyway
And the ladies treat me kindly
From phony jealousy
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And I'm leaving every day to run away
So, I'm walking down your highway
But I can't deny
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Or if you just want some company
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
I laid on the dune and I looked at the sky
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Maggie says that many say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Don't you tell Henry
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
That I done it the way
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
If I don't take the chance to try
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
My mind weaves a symphony
Spouted out that liberty
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
For them that think death's honesty
She puts it to me plain as day
She starts to speak, but he walks away
I did not do it harmfully
My ears hear a symphony
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
She smiles, walks the other way
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
The Spanish-American War had its day
The night is pitch black, come and make my
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
And that which you've given me today
To those condemned to act accordingly
A cock is crowing far away
Went to the doctor the very next day
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Though I'd never say
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
No, you'll not now or no other day
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
That I was just a puppet in a play
Well, I saw it advertised one day
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
For them that think death--death's honesty
So I run down most hurriedly
And the only tune my guitar could play
The same thing I would want today
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
We banged the drum slowly
And it's up to you to say
For them that must obey authority
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
But you can never steal away
And for His love they took His life away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
So they took him to the infirmary
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Is worth more than I could pay
I send you all my money
Well, I'm walking down the highway
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
