She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
Howdy, East Orange!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
I've got the freight train blues!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
I've got a million friends!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
How they ever flood my soul!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Play that guitar now!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Yippee!
My God, they killed Him!
Take me down to California, baby!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Thank you!
Alright!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Oh!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
They got away!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Lordy, Lord!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
So long, New York!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Well!
It was the mailman!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Goodnight!
Woo-hoo!
Dignity never been photographed!
Good God!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Them Reds did it!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
Hootenanny television!
Start over!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
Betty Ross!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
They was all over!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Oh, yeah!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Oh, no!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
I'm in love with you!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Alright, now!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
She's insane!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
You must think I'm crazy!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I ain't different than anyone!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Dance!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Looking for my lo and behold!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
I wanna be yours!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Yeah, man!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
He punched me out!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Yes, come out your window!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
I got the freight train blues!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Would kill a little bird like me."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
I would want again tomorrow."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
They look as dark as night."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And keep him good company."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
But we were tangled up in blue."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
It's all for the love of thee."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
He said, "Tell me about it."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
But I know what you want."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
You can't blame us at all."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Have it on Highway 61."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
You can't blame me at all."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Come flowing down so free?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
I love far better than thee."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
That you must always first forgive them."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You and I'll never know."
"That way down Highway 61."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Tangled up in blue."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Get on your horse and ride away."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
And it's all for the love of thee."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"Is it easy to forget?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
And says, "Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
I can't find my knees."
Country'll grow."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
So write to her tenderly."
I'll bring back my lady."
And pretend that you never have met."
I didn't see you around."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
I'll see her soon, I know."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
We want folksingers here."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
And hung on a willow tree."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
They look as white as snow."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
"Have you seen dignity?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Will mourn for your return."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
And punched my cigarette."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
From across that lonesome ocean."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
We'll both go home together."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
You must know about my debutante."
We'll both go off together."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And have it on Highway 61."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Where you and I will unite."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
If'n you don't know by now,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
That fired the gun,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
I want you,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
But I will be back, I will survive,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Just remember that death is not the end,
And, though the line is cut,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
As easy it was to tell black from white,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
But you were gambling for support,
I'm pledging my time to you,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Speaking to some French girl,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Too noble to neglect,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
And comes to a permanent stop,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Want you,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
With what your fate is going to be,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
But evidently she don't,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Tell me,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
The winter would hold no spring,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Simplify you, classify you,
But, to remain as friends,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
On this new morning, new morning,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
And on the highway of regret,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Dream about you, baby,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
So I got those worries blues,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
My arms and legs were broken,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
For she ain't the same,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Watching the river flow,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
But he can't be blamed,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
And I don't want to drag you down,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
You can stick your head in the sand,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
But it would not be new,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
You married young just like your ma,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Name of Martin Luther King,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Never weak, but always strong,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
As human gods aim for their mark,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
God knows it's outta sight,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
For all intended purposes,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I went into the red, went into the black,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
God knows there's a purpose,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
You say my kisses are not like his,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
When the night comes falling,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
A dream about you, baby,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
And point away from the past,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
And I'm just like that bird,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
From their fates try to resign,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
And here I sit so patiently,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
You need something to open up a new door,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Broken threads, broken springs,
She said she would always stay,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Each time we meet, love,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
The sky too is folding over you,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Nothing too very scientific,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Don't let her know that you love her,
China doll, alcohol,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Made before the foundation of the world,
In another I witnessed a crime,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
And give him back the time he's done,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Where mercy walks the plank,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Thinking about the government,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
With no direction home,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
He's not selling any alibis,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Pressing on,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
People going down to the ground,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
For something that he never done,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
To be––direction home,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Icicles hanging down,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
You got something I want plenty of,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
And also by his feet,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
God knows everything,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
First degree and second degree,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I thank the Lord,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Wintertime in New York town,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
I'm leaving today,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Love that's pure no accident,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
And the sooner you come up with them,
To protect his white skin,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
She leave by the other and roam,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
All the silver, all the gold,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Where I will always be renewed,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Advertising signs, they con,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
You always responded when I needed your help,
I want you so bad,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
How many a year has passed and gone,
One by one they followed the sun,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
If not for you,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Heart of mine, be still,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
They don't believe in mercy,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Had no one to go my bail,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
More people kept a-piling on,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Get born, keep warm,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Circled by the circus sands,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
But ye shall be a-changed,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Carry the New York Times,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Don't try No Doz,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Going home,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
At the close of the day,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Said I'm pressing on,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Staying far behind without you,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Love don't have any place,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
It's alright,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
All you can do is do what you must,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Memory, ecstasy,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
The country doctor rambles,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
That her father was going to hang,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
The angels play on their horns all day,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Going, going,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Carved next to his name,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
You even make love just like a woman,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
We never much thought we could get very old,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Waiting for the trains,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
How does it feel,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
In one the surface was frozen,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Stripping away at it all,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
How he died nobody can say,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
You've got to serve somebody,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
So unknown,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
God don't call it wrong,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Tell her not to worry,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Without your sweet love,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
I need a shot of love,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
When all will be well,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Far away and over the wall,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
And I got those worried blues,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Six months on the chain gang,
I'm going out of my mind,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
But you try with your whole soul,
If she ain't feeling well,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
You were striped, you were plain,
Hazel, you called and I came,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
They say every man needs protection,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
You better duck down the alleyway,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
They must bust in early May,
In his anger and his shame,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Don't let yourself fall,
It was from her ship sailing,
Oh, singing just for you,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
The air is getting hotter,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Up and down the block,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
That five walls cannot hide him,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Don't let her hear,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
He been around the world and back again,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Seven days,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
They say every man must need protection,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Don't matter what you did,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
And played the fife lowly,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
It's not aimed at anyone,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
This world is ruled by violence,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Trouble,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
"Not me," said his manager,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Far away in the stormy night,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Nothing was delivered,
One by one they follow the sun,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Like some mystery,
Heart of mine,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
You got something better,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
You don't want a love that's pure,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Just like I did before,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
If I didn't have to guess,
Look who's back in town,
They say everything can be replaced,
My love, she speaks like silence,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
And gathering storms may arise,
God knows when,
You'll change your last name, too,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Ten thousand men on the move,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
They say that every man must fall,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Precious father, loving mother,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
It hurts me, too,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
I think we better talk this over,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Winter would have no spring,
Went back home to the yard,
That one doctor cannot save him,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Just like a rolling stone,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
See you fly or watch you die,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
You can raise up your right hand,
Of this I can't say very much,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Face full of black soot,
Yes, I want you so bad,
But the time ain't tall,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
When there is no more,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Since you've been gone,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I'm so glad,
The country music station plays soft,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Can't find what I need,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
And I got the worried blues,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
You can run down to the desert,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
If anything is gonna sell,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I try my best to be just like I am,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Loyalty, unity,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Keep a clean nose,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
I got a bird that whistles,
The joint is jumping,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Like you never did before,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
You got to serve somebody,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Over the hills and far away,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Now you don't talk so loud,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Try hard, get barred,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
And come every time you call,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And it's only that I'm asking,
And ride a horse along the trail,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
But I know that he don't talk,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
You have explained every mystery,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
It's really something,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Strangers all give me the news,
In the ruins of your balcony,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Father of time and father of dreams,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
If you throw it all away,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Mercury, gravity,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
It always means so much,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Better jump down a manhole,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
There's always someone who understands,
It don't matter what you did,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
It always has hit me from below,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
I never can go because, you know,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
The path you've endured has been rough,
They––they show me to the door,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
My senses have been stripped,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Using every angle under the sun,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
King of the streets, child of clay,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Don't let her know,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Too serious to fool,
Well, I gave you all my money,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Alright, I'm so glad,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Gonna serve somebody,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
I try my best to be like I am,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
May be an actor in a plot,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Someone to close his heart,
I'd already gone the distance,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
You gotta look some other place,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
I been riding the midnight train,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
It could even be like a myth,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Oh, watered-down love,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
For his age he is wise,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Give you my money, honey,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Try to be a success,
In the lonely night,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Saved,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Stone you and say good luck,
He won't do nothing to you,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Is it really any wonder,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
But the bottles are done,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Father of night, father of day,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
I don't care if you analyze me,
How he died nobody could say,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Don't tie no bows,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
And the point is slick,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I'm never, never far from home,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Don't wanna be a bum,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Precious angel under the sun,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
All I really wanna do,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Socialism, hypnotism,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Watch the river flow,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Ooh, watered-down love,
With his candle lit into the sun,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Every brain is civilized,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Take the motherless children off the street,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
God knows it's true,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I just don't see why I should even care,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Somewhere down the road some day,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
And to come every time you call,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Going,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
God knows it's terrifying,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Spent my money on you, honey,
That can do what's a-never been done,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Better jump down the manhole,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
You to me were true,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Why she did go,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
And to come each time you call,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I went into the city, into the town,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Well, I been gambling so long,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Heart of mine, go back home,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
In the turning of twilight,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
They say every distance is not near,
Read books and repeat quotations,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
One summer's day he came passing by,
God knows there's a chance,
Well, I may just swear,
Bringing me all of your charms,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
But it ain't me, babe,
That can do what's never been done,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Look away, you rolling river,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
They lowered him down as a king,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Tears on the letter that I write,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Every head is so dignified,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
That you'd have liked me to,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
You're beautiful to me,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
In the image of someone you used to know,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Mixing up the medicine,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
The man in the trench-coat,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
She said she would never forget,
That two healers cannot heal him,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Eh, see what you can do,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Serve somebody,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
She never does me wrong,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Well, I can't understand,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
I got the worried blues,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
To stay closer than any friend,
A hand set the spark,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
To be out on your own,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Out to the windy beach,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
I'd be sad and blue,
Seem like I been down this way before,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Watch the plain-clothes,
I march in the parade of liberty,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Laying low,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
That fellow who never blushes,
Ever since I been a child,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
We'll go someplace unknown,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Going, going, gone,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Without a dream in my heart,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
In the darkness of my night,
All the tired horses in the sun,
They keep it all hid,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Father of minutes, father of days,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
With a killer's pride, security,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
By rivers of blindness,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
He's young and on fire,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Paradise, sacrifice,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Aim well, my little one,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Well, well, well,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Human gods aim for their mark,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
We live in a political world,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
As his youth now unfolds,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
You had enough of hatred,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Trust yourself,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Resent him to the bone,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
A man named Martin Luther King,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
It's like I ain't here,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
To shine in through,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
You will be alright, girl,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
People talk over situations,
I shall be released,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
And forget my pride,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Courage is a thing of the past,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Just don't know what to do,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
True love, they've been without it,
Of ancient history,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
People talk of situations,
For the wise men and the fools,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
God knows you ain't pretty,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
The man there said he loved my sound,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
She's crying like an evil stone,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Never needed to call you my whore,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Who could they get to carry you,
I've been in and out of happiness,
A true love of mine,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Like as not, it's better so,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
May be living in another country under another name,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
But he's the property of Jesus,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Every moon is so sanctified,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
I tried to reach you, honey,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Don't let me change my heart,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Is looking for a new fool,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
And your streets are getting empty,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
For her to arrive,
To keep up his hate,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
You stole her love from me one day,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
A man with a badge skips by,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
For the politician's gain,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Private reasons, great or small,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
I've been around this whole country,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
That four ears cannot hear him,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
The kingdoms of experience,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
You don't have to feed me,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
To hang and to lynch,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
God knows how to make it flow,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Stay away from the train line,
Like a complete unknown,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Five by five they tried to survive,
It's rising up above my head,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
You have given me eyes to see,
I went down where the vultures feed,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
In the hills of mystery,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
I would not feel so all alone,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
The train leaves at half past ten,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
I rambled out of New York town,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Madams light the candles,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
If you must cling to someone,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
But, if I will save you the time,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
I had so much left to do,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Equality, liberty,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
And, if I can save you any time,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Eh, in somebody's room,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I can see the turning of the key,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
How many times have you heard someone say,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Bring the wife and family,
Don't ever try to change me,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Don't wear sandals,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
But I've been hanging on,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
With the juice running down my leg,
I wish tonight were here,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
I want my arms around you,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Go down to the river, babe,
When I was in Missouri,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Don't let her see,
Yes, and I'll go last,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
So many roads, so much at stake,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
You were snow, you were rain,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Want you so bad,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
We take great delight in our own company,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Is used, it is plain,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
And I'm back in the rain,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Oh, see what you can do,
And, if I see the day,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
To gather flowers constantly,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Front door shut, back door too,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
If ever I prove false to you,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
She's opened up a happy home,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Who among them would try to impress you,
To be without a home,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Whether you are right or wrong,
As the present now will later be past,
I long to see you in the morning light,
But it ain't him to blame,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Friends with you,
He got that soft, silky skin,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Without a love of my own,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Well, get sick, get well,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Stand up straight and tall,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
I'd only have to stay,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
They took a clean-cut kid,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
I got no place left to turn,
In the great unknown,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Under the microscope,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Don't follow leaders,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
A million faces at my feet,
I get my sweet reward,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
If you'd see me this way,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
By users, cheaters,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
The light I never knowed,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Don't let yourself stumble,
I bless the day I found you,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I threw it all away,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
The Second World War came to an end,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
And furnish me with tape,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Yet every distance is not near,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But now morning is clear,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
And they––they look at me and frown,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
But something has changed,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
People carry roses,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
You have given me life to live,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
My dear, sweet friend,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
And pretend that we never have touched,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
But, if you want me to,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
God knows that, when you see it,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
While paupers change possessions,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Ah, get sick, get well,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
The day would surely have to break,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
She'll be coming forth,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
On the stone that remains,
A complete unknown,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
I'm going back to Colorado,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Automobile coming into style,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
And I'm so glad,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I like the way that you move your hips,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Read books, repeat quotations,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
I went back home, put on my tie,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Got my mind made up,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
He's the property of Jesus,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Vanished from my hand,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Into my own parade,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Relationships of ownership,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
God knows you've got to weep,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
She would have married me,
You wanna drown love,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
God knows it's a crime,
With his fist in a clinch,
I know I can't win,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
A thousand miles from home,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Oxford Town around the bend,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
New morning,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
To have––be on your own,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
"Not I," said the referee,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
So, never leave me lonely,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
To be on your own,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
But, if I can save you any time,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
She'll surely turn to white,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Grandpa died last week,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
May you stay forever young,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
The night blows cold and rainy,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
My love, she speaks softly,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
I just say no thanks,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
The night would see me wide awake,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Far away from it all,
My limbs are shaking,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Thieving in the alley,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
You have laid down Your life for me,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Every nerve is analyzed,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Each one playing a horn,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
In love and with kindness,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Make you spin or do you in,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Where life and death are memorized,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Father of loneliness and pain,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
To know how much I really care,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Just then the order came to charge,
May be the head of some big TV network,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
The night passed away so quickly,
That the laws are with him,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Forever young, forever young,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
I just don't know what to do,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
This situation can only get rougher,
No, nothing was delivered,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
When God and man will be reconciled,
And the table's full and overflowed,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
That foreign sound in your ear,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
She's the worst you could ever have,
The one we can see and can feel,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
A foreign sound to your ear,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I got those worried blues,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Oh, Angelina,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
My woman's never sitting at home,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'll be on my way,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
She got great big hind legs,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
And the whole world is on your case,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
They say every man must fall,
But I'm saved,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
It's a price I have to pay,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Joey, Joey,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Newspapermen eating candy,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Or select you or dissect you,
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Don't you tell Henry,
You better chew gum,
When I seen him lose control,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Looking 'bout the government,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
I can make it through,
I been good while I been waiting,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Someone to open each and every door,
You made it there somehow,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Without ideals or violence,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Broken hands on broken plows,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Thank You, Lord,
To be alone with you,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
I just can't beg you anymore,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
And she aches just like a woman,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
She once was a true love of mine,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
God knows it's a struggle,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Father who build the mountain so high,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
The haunted, frightened trees,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
It still ain't me, babe,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Go melt back in the night,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Go away from my window,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Broken idols, broken heads,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
I won't have my nature way,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
There she come, now, down my way,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
I can't understand,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Don't let me drift too far,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Well, I'm so glad,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
I'm going down the river,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
"Come along and take a trip,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I went into the city, went into the town,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
You and me, we had completeness,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
In the end,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
God knows there's a river,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Or have done something wrong,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Silhouetted by the sea,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Far past the frozen leaves,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
You have given everything to me,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
The phone's tapped anyway,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
The day you quit me, baby,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I got a wife and five little children,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Three angels up above the street,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
The sky too is folding under you,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
But, deep inside my heart,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Hold me, baby, be near,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
I got two white horses following me,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
To strict party-platform ties,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I got my mind made up,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Father of day, father of night,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Ye shall be changed,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
I've been saved – well, alright,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
You have given all there is to give,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Searching high, searching low,
We'll fly the night away,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
If today was not a crooked highway,
And, although that we're single and free,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Get back, write Braille,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Never did feel this way before,
I can change, I swear,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Just to know that you are near,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Baby, please stop crying,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Who will promise never to part,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
And she'll be coming forth,
You need something to open your eyes,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
They tell me every man must fall,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Three by three they're turning the key,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
And it's like I ain't here,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
God don't call it treason,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
When she lays upon the grass,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
If you'd see me this a-way,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
To your tambourine in time,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
The beat is pumping,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Come all without, come all within,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Over your senses you have no control,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
And, if anybody asks me,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
It was you who came right through,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
And you know I could never be your own,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
God knows it's fragile,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
To find out if she's talked,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
The only son of God Almighty,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Corrina, Corrina,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
And think they're fooling you,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
To a solid rock,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
In the instant that I preach,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
And I'm in the shade,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
In the little church a-this side of town,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
It's too bad he had to go,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Searching everywhere I know,
I'd give you the sky high above,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
The wind blowing the snow around,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
To be so useless and all,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Yes, I'm so glad,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
I just keep pressing on,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Father of black, father of white,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
And it ain't me, babe,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
They say every man need protection,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Light yourself a candle,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
And there's two white horses following me,
And she makes love just like a woman,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
But you're doing it again,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
But I would not feel so all alone,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
And not going through any great extreme,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
I ain't looking to block you up,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
And may you stay forever young,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Well, there ain't no going back,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Got me a secret membership card,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
In the foggy web of destiny,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Eh, singing just for you,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Father of air and father of trees,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I should have left this town this morning,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I been good,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
He is centuries old,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
All them prophets good and gone,
Precious memories, how they linger,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
And you make love just like a woman,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
God knows there's a heaven,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Need a woman all the time,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Looking for a new fool,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Drifting too far from shore,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Made of silver or of golden,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
My woman needs it every day,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Father of cold and father of heat,
I don't want to meet your kin,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Beating for the dead that rise,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Keep me where you are,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
So glad,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Tell me that you love me only,
And you take just like a woman,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Ain't no going back,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
I once held her in my arms,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Like a rolling stone,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
You want watered-down love,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
That must be what it's all about,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I have no one to meet,
You could look at it and weep,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
I can't be good, baby,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Day you quit me, baby,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
But I'm pressing on,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Not the end, not the end,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
One by one until there were none,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
By losers, cheaters,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
While riding on a train going west,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
We've killed each one,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Watered-down love,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Look out, kid,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
The Communists was a-coming around,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Hang around the ink-well,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Badge out, laid off,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
God sees it all unfold,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
True love of mine,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Like a dog on a chain,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Democracy don't rule the world --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
That's where you belong --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Without ideals or violence.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Hear me singing through these tears.
And I's left alone with three children.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
After losing every battle.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Some place so high above the wall.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
You cast your spell and I went under.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
I can't fire them anymore.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Baby, baby...
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
With gold and silver in her hand.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
To reach of your rattling drums.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
I shall be released.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Just like so many times before.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
And pretend that we never have touched.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
I'm not the one you need.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Until I threw it all away.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Suffering like a fool.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
And he was a friend of mine.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Hope I don't blow it.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
I just can't see through it anymore.
I'm sad and lonely too.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Patriotism, materialism.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Bid farewell forever.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
My baby took my heart from me.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
I got nothing left to burn.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
And light on your right knee.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
To the sin of love's false security.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Adiós, mi corazón.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I hope you're ready.
So long, honey babe.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
That I left in the French Quarter.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
But I know that I can't move.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
They both rode off together.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Is just equality in school.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
In the dark land of the sun.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
That which is not permanent don't last.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Father of love and father of rain.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
You're too hot, darling.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Four by four they turn it some more.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Oh, Angelina.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I once held her in my arms.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
You break your promise all over the place.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Just what this song is all about.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
The sooner you can go.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
For the times, they are a-changing.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
She's in some foreign land.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
And ye shall be changed.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
You're a big girl all the way.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Said it was a bad dream.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
It's just the same as talking to you.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
The night will soon be gone.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Gone as the season she's taken.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
While the law looks the other way.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
Tomorrow will be another day.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
The light I never knowed.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Join the army if you fail.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
That's the day you die.
My love winks, she does not bother.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
And you must realize the danger.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
68, but says he's 24.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
Go lightly on the ground.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
It'll never do, somehow.
While evening slips away.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
Good as I been to you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
And rivers that ran through every day.
You're my baby.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
He gone north for a while.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
I said that.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Just you and me.
I want everybody to be free.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Someone to open each and every door.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Watch the parking meters.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Drink up your blood like wine.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Dollar a day's worth.
I'll be your baby tonight.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
She once was a true love of mine.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
You know, I loved her just the same.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Neighborhood bully.
With the glory that is to be.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
I think this time we should escape.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Friends with you.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
And your golden loom.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
Don't remember one thing more.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
It only brings me sorrow.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Wasn't any difference to me.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
I seen a man.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
You sound like a hillbilly.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
High society, notoriety.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Honey, baby.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
"And light on my right knee.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
To the old folks' home and the college.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
You won't get it for money.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Or stay all night with thee.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
No kindred or relative nigh.
You give something up for everything you gain.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
I find it so difficult to leave.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Carry for you deep down inside.
But you break just like a little girl.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Because everybody must get stoned.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
But simply because it's true.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
With the golden loom.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
That old ship was a-going down.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
At not getting their money's worth.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
Someone's watching over you.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
If you throw it all away.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
I been in this thing too long.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Honey, I never would have come.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
For me to return to or chase.
Oh, her darling love she found.
But these to tell what's true.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
They found him dead in the street one day.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Nobility, humility.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
New morning.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Going back where we come from.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Baby, please come home.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
When my memory is not so short.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Look a-the other way.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
In the pale moonlight.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Turned on my record player.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
In fond memory appear.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
You can show me a new place to start.
Everybody's having them dreams.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
When I paint my masterpiece.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Everything inside is made of stone.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Tried to create a next world war.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Crying out that he was framed.
Who says she knows me well.
And that failure's no success at all.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
And without further notice he asks you how it feels.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
If I ride back again.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Some speak of the future.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Funny way to start a picnic.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Hope that it don't sleet.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
There was nobody around.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Some place so high above this wall.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
He went down to Oxford Town.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Tangled up in blue.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
It was a normal day.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
It was you who understood.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
I'm just average, common too.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Memories of what used to be.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.

I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
To see that you're madly in love.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
It runs both cold and deep.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
A foreign sound to your ear.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
The words that her lover had said.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
And say you'll always let it be me.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
It's just the old American way.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Baby, baby.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
The sooner you can leave.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
I'll only let you down.
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
You only got ten.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
What's real and what is not.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
And it is time for me to slide.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
But she had some way of finding them out.
The same as my father before him.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Kisses she gave him three.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
In the palace of the Pope.
Honey, I want you.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
You may not see me tomorrow.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
You are on the bottom.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
We may not make it through the night.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Figuring a way to get back home.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
I want you.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Everybody must get stoned.
I know something is changed.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
God knows...
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
Tell me.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Mama, you been on my mind.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
I see better days and I do better things.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
But he sure left here in style.
You left me standing out in the cold.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
All my connections too.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Going through all these things twice.
I'll hold it down for you.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
But you're not even sure what it is.
Epitome, rigidity.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
He's got his mother's eyes.
Go find out something only dead men know.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
But mine was a little different, you see.
She acts like we never met.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Tell me that it isn't true.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Now and forever let it be me.
Drifting too far from shore.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Even the softest touch.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Got my mind made up.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
I just go pump on it some.
Remember, before you come, at least please first telephone.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Waiting on my burying ground.
She said she would always stay.
I took some comfort there.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
I froze right to the bone.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
I'll remember you.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Going, going, gone.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
But you're back where you belong.
That big, old boat started to sink.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Billy, you been running for so long.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
I can walk anytime around the block.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
To be alone with you.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
There were six thousand people there.
But with the country to where you're going.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Is what this thing here is for.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Or define you or confine you.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
So the radio didn't work so well.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Broken voices on broken phones.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
You're my honey.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
I just can't do what I done before.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
While I'm in the hall.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Like you never done before.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
And they gotta cut something.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
That last night I was with.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom".
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
At the sorority sisters' home.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
To see what kinda words he could say.
So, darling, you better come through.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Hope you're ready.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
And no time to think.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Heart of mine.
Lord, protect my child.
If not for you.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Is gonna be against the law.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
And the morning will be breaking.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Close your eyes, close the door.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Fighting every inch of the way.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
The next day could be your last.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
When I run outta things to investigate.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
His mama sure was proud of him.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
Just crying out that he was framed.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
And I've never been too impressed.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Right now I'm having trouble.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Come on, baby...
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Life don't mean a thing.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Soft as music, light as spring.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
The National Guard stands around his door.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
If'n you don't know by now.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
Is when I'm alone with you.
I couldn't find any.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Every link was Jesus's name.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Please let me ride you home.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
See him at play makes me smile.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Come on, baby.
Trying to create a next world war.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
Come on, darling.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
To kill with no pain.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
That's the way I remember her best.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
So many people I never saw in my life.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
It hurts me, too.
I been worrying about you, baby.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
It always does when you're with me.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
If you just let me come home with you.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Rode slowly back again.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
In the border-towns of despair.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
The time and the place that we'd part.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Find out something only dead men know.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
And discovered her invisible self.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
They don't make nothing here no more.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Leave no stone unturned.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
You got a heart of stone.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
And you only got ten.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Without a love of my own.
I hate bears.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
"And stay all night with me.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Slowly into autumn.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
And it never seemed strange.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
Come on, honey.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Valentines can't buy her.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
My face you'll never see no more.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
And she had left him to die in there.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Rain would gather, too.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
If you just let me follow you down.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
The last radio is playing.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
And the night blows rainy.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
I got trouble in my mind.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
In the brightness of my day.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
His epitaph plain:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Serve somebody:
Yeah, serve somebody:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Man is opposed to fair play:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
But there's one promise, darling:
Till I come into New York town:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Make promises by the hour;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Had to be held down by big police;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Crumble into one another;
I find complete love;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Some speak of the future;
Everybody that was hanging out;
All lies and jest;
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
About everybody that was hanging out;
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
But who did I see but the one I love?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Across the swooping plain?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
How many more without any reward?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
When he's standing in front of you?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
That too many people have died?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Can you get back in?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
How many more can they afford?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Must everybody bow?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
What would life be?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Have they missed you?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
What can I give to You?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Am I ready?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
What good am I?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Has anybody seen my love?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Too many people have died?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Across the swamp of time?
Baby, can I come home with you?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Before you call him a man?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Oh, where are you tonight?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
I seen better times, but who has not?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Am I still dreaming yet?
How can I live for You?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
And how does it feel?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
How much poison did they inhale?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
And one deserving of affection?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
What's wrong with you this time?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How does it feel?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Baby, what more can I tell?
What else can a poor boy do?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
To love and follow His direction?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Before they're forever banned?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
How could they let you go?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
How come you don't send me no regards?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
What can I do for You?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
What do you think about that, my friend?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
By golly, what more can I say?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
But am I still dreaming yet?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
When did you leave heaven?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Where did you lose your wings?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Gal, where you been so long?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Are you ready?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Before they're allowed to be free?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Before he can hear people cry?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
How many compared to yesterday?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Why would I want to take your life?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Where did you hide your halo?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Why and what's the reason for?
Like a rolling stone?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Just like a rolling stone?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
How could they ever mistake you?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
How's everything in heaven?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Does anyone even try?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Can I come home with you?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Just what in the world has come over you?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Oh, how could you refuse?
For all these earthly things?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Baby, can't you tell?
Of everything you see?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Before he can see the sky?
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
You try so hard, but you don't understand
I will not go down under the ground
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Silvio, silver and gold
Nothing was delivered
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
They took a clean-cut kid
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
But she ain't gonna find the road
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
I live in another world
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Then came the warning that was before the flood
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Things would be different the next time we wed
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
I thought that it was well-understood
To see him obviously framed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
While some, on principles baptized
But something has changed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Now, whenever I get up and
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Now, a very great man once said
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
By no special friend
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
There ain't nothing in this world
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
I still can remember the way that you smiled
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
I want you, baby, just to understand
And things would be different the next time we wed
For what you sold that's not been received
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Just what you had in mind
Somebody seen him hanging around
He was a clean-cut kid
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
It's something you did
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
We live in a political world
She let go of my hand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
You used to be so amused
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
All the sweethearts you can hold
Everything stays down where it's wounded
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
And your trouble is you know it too good
"Equality". I spoke the word
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Now you don't act so––so proud
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
You used––be so proud
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Now you don't seem so proud
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Its iron claws attached
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
I run right home and I went to bed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
I had to say something to strike him very weird
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And into the path you are hurled
I'll always thank the Lord
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Maybe someday you will understand
Many times I've often prayed
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
As I stand upon the sand
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
So I'll make my stand
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
How many times can a man turn his head
But now something has changed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
I've been walking around
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
And those whom doom and death had spared
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
And then you told me later as I apologized
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
The changes I was going through can't even be used
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
She knows there's no success like failure
With all memory and fate
Little did I realize
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And plenty time for good romance
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
When the roses fade
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Full of hope and desire
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Remember me to the one who lives there
And never sat once at the head of the table
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
You're not free to belong to me
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Mona tried to tell me
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Breaking hearts up and down the line
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And suddenly there appeared before me
As he rises to fame
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
We see this empty cage now corrode
Limited in sex they dare
What good am I then to others and me
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
All I feel is heat and flame
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
But the dark does die
Why wait any longer for the one you love
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
At dawn my lover comes to me
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
It's all new to me
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Should I put them by your gate
It'll be with me unto the grave
There were times when I was so lonesome
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Should I leave them by your gate
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
I can survive and I can endure
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
You into thinking you're the one
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Maybe someday you will look back and see
The crashing waves roll over me
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
And I would send a message
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
You cut to the core
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Well, six white horses that you did promise
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Says it's closing time
Feel to moan, but unlike before
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
"That I might be gone a long, old time
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
I am homeless, come and take me
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
It's getting dark, too dark to see
A bed that is never mine
So I remember every face
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
And you see why it's so unique to be
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
He'll see by his grave
Waiting to find out what price
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
You say you're looking for someone
Up into some paradise
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Hunger pays a heavy price
You said you'd never compromise
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
If dogs run free, why not we
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And that is that one must always flush out his house
But I can get another one
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
She been gone
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
While them that defend what they cannot see
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
And the Negro's name
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
But I feel nothing for their game
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
If dogs run free, why not me
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Just pick anyone
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Well, it's all new to me
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
I don't even notice she gone
They say don't come back no more
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Most of the time I can't even be sure
When I'm all alone
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Knows there's no success like failure
On the rising curve
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
I been wondering all about me
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And her silver-studded phantom cause
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
And I ain't complaining none
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
What about that millionaire
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
The cause was there before we came
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Just what you will say when you get home
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
She plunged him into well water where
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Lies that life is black-and-white
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
From the start by the rule
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
"It's only you that he does crave
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Better stay away from those
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
"Oh, father, you will surely die
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
You know, it's not even safe no more
Though its shadow's metal badge
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
How was I to know you'd be the one
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
The man the authorities came to blame
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Remember me to one who lives there
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
When the rain is blowing in your face
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
To show you something you seen before
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
So, I called up the operator of time
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
If dogs run free, then what must be
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
So up she picked her babies three
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
From all the plans they do pursue
Among the lovely people living free
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And I'm just the same as anyone else
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Con you into thinking that you're the one
That she's the same one
But I can't say I sympathize
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
I rode with him in a taxi once
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
How many ears must one man have
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
To give the special one you seek a chance
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
When Reilly's daughter got a message
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Taking care of somebody nice
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
I'm ready for to fade
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
From the Golden Gate Bridge
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I do declare
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
What's probably got you baffled more
So I look like a walking mountain range
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Looking at hands for the lines that were
You just pick anyone
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
The order is rapidly fading
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
The battle outside raging
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Where the time and the tempo drag
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
There's nothing in here moving
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
If I was with her too long
But then a whistle will be blowing
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
I know that you know that I know that you show something
For your weary toes to be a-touching
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
It's not a bad way to make a living
You left me standing in the doorway crying
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Early in the morning, early in the morning
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
She rode by night and came by morning
'Cause the battle outside raging
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
What am I saying? What am I knowing
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Deceived me into thinking
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Well, I set my monkey on the log
I can hear their hearts a-beating
The order is a-rapidly fading
They're drinking up and walking
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
For your weary toes to be touching
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
I have fallen far beneath
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
And how I know I'll make it through
You go north and you go south
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Then she told us how times were tough
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The man in me will do nearly any task
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
You turn around to take a final peek
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
I wish she'd unlock
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Her voice once and talk
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Shoot in the back
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Well, there ain't no going back
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Make everything from toy guns that spark
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
But among the dead that were left on the hill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
How does it feel
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
They ask me how I feel
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
He's taught in his school
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Ring bar, hard to tell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
How many seas must the white dove sail
Then why don't she tell
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Ring bell, hard to tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
A-how does it feel
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
I chased me a woman up the hill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
How many seas must a white dove sail
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
And if my love is real
As the last fire-truck from hell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
A girl by the whirlpool
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
He's sure got a lot of gall
Oh, how does it feel
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
All and all can only fall
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Muttering small talk at the wall
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But I can hear another drum
So, one morning when the sun was warm
You better not chew gum
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And remain as I am
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
Two eyes took the aim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
"For you cannot relive them
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Darkness at the break of noon
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Their religion of the little ten women
But I swear I see my reflection
You need something to make it known
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
I'll be waiting at the station
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
And you ache a-just like a woman
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Please don't let on that you knew me when
She got such a sweet disposition
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
And she aches just like a woman
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
A-she takes just like a woman
Have died in battle or in vain
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
You don't need a weatherman
As you sit on the box you keep him in
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Will not be understood as they're spoken
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Somebody new to beat on
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
There was little to say, there was no conversation
That long, black train is pulling on down
Out of the shower comes a football man
Guns and clubs followed him down
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
To remember the times when I was your only man
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
But the second mom was with the seventh son
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
The foreign sun, it squints upon
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
That long, black train is pulling down
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
The next morning she had awoken
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Well, you fake just like a woman
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
In ceremonies of the horsemen
And there's no exit in any direction
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
How many roads must a man walk down
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
He got that fortress on the mountain
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
But the post office has been stolen
"Not me," said the gambling man
In the pigpen
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
And she wakes just like a woman
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
You take just like a woman
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
All lay down their bandanas and complain
All their daughters put me down
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
But all their daughters put me down
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Must meet the dawn
My love, she's like some raven
And all their daughters put me down
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
But it's hard to think on
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
To my knowledge there's just one man
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
But me, I expected it to happen
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
For the loser now will be later to win
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Yes, and someone must explain
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Trying to get a lead on
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
For the loser now might be later to win
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Suicide remarks are torn
I figure maybe we're even
Why did you trade heaven
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Yet I swear I see my reflection
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
The ones that jump on the wagon
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Well, I'm hanging on
Advertising signs that con
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
But the second mother was with the seventh son
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Uncle Rat went running downtown
She said that all the railroad men
She takes just like a woman
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
From heights that they could not gain
And the corner sign
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
How can the life of such a man
Every place I wanna go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
There's nothing you can say or do
There is a place you go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
All I'd like you to do
All I really wanna do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Silvio, I gotta go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
The man in the coon-skin cap
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
How many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
What good am I while you softly weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Aladdin and his lamp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
I walked down there and ended up
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
I don't have to go far
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
She took him by his long, yellow hair
I could feel a whole lot better
Still I've always kind of missed her
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Never no more do I wonder
When only you are near
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Who came here from Cuba's door
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
But morning is clear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
For I am married to a house carpenter
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
In one I was running and in another
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
At any moment you could go under
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
The face of God will appear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
When you whispered in my ear
I close my eyes and I wonder
All you boys better run for cover
Still I say her love-words over
So, don't fear if you hear
Alone you stand with nobody near
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
For all eternity I think I will remember
The wind howls like a hammer
And I don't even think about her
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
I say, "Why you say that for
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
You heard me saying a prayer for
The lover who has just walked out your door
Six-time users
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Good and bad, I define these terms
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Well, the ragman draws circles
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
I'd gladly confess
To sharpen the senses
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Statues made of matchsticks
You know that he has no intentions
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Don't wear sandals
Now, you must provide some answers
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
The empty-handed painter from your streets
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
To memorizing politics
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
How many deaths will it take till he knows
People carry roses
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
You should be made to wear earphones
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I was thinking of a series of dreams
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
As friends and other strangers
But, though the masters make the rules
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And your father, to your sister he explains
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
He's not selling any alibis
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Wants eleven dollar bills
You can fall down on your knees
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
We living in times when men commit crimes
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I try to tell it like it is
You been hurt so many times
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Mama, you know, awaits the news
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
True love can make a blade of grass
To the cutting of fences
With a fantastic collection of stamps
And the princess and the prince discuss
Glide across the lonely years
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
What good am I if I say foolish things
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Romantic facts of musketeers
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
You never turned around to see the frowns
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
With a big bouquet of the roses
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And tells me of her dreams
People on the platforms
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And I try to harmonize with songs
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
The cowboy angel rides
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Thinking of a series of dreams
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
At times I think there are no words
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And then complains
And, though the masters make the rules
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And the poor white remains
Girl by the whirlpool's
"Not me," said the man whose fists
They whisper in the wings
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
On the back of the fish truck that loads
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
But still remains
In the dimestores and bus-stations
I'm gonna let you pass
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Her window's wide open, African trees
Six-time losers
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Seven days
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
That it's you and no one else that owns
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And so Patty calls the cops
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Don't follow leaders
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And inside it with the people made of molasses
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Everything is always right
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
But, if the arrow is straight
In the precious winds they rot
You're hearing my heart beat
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
The slowest now will later be fast
And, since my feet are now fast
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
Talking that the heat put
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
They tell me revenge is sweet
With your pockets well protected at last
You don't forget
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
There's some people that
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
I'm on the pavement
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
How many years can a mountain exist
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
He built a fire on Main Street
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
One more night I will wait for the light
You used to laugh about
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Well, I finally started thinking straight
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Wait for the morning light
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Everyone still talks about
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
But, then again, there's only one I've met
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
You used to laugh–make fun about
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
In the stillness of the midnight
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
To hold each other tight
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
You are there in the flickering light
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
One more night the moon is shining bright
Oh, everybody's got to eat
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Without any doubt
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
That might be all that you got
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Every new messenger bringing evil report
You're gonna get hit
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
It don't take too long to find out
Plants in the bed, but
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
And the first one now will later be last
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
They tell me to be discreet
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Keep me set apart
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
He really wasn't where it's at
I think that it's best
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I soon get some rest
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
I got into the driver's seat
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
So he never thinks straight
Someday, everything is gonna be different
She seems too far out
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Johnny's in the basement
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
And I, in my armor, turning about
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
The slow one now will later be fast
How many years can some people exist
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Keep it in your mind and not forget
By the way, that's a cute hat
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
To be alone with you
To protect you and defend you
I'll remember you
It's just crazy being here with you
I can be just like you
And I tell this truth to you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I just might have to come see you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
The only one I know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
With only you in view
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Sooner or later one of us must know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Don't it always go to show
Don't it always a-go to show
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Well, I'd sure like to know
He been living there three years now
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
But sooner or later one of us must know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
It only goes to show
Ring them bells for the chosen few
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
For them that think death––death's honesty
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Spouted out that liberty
No, you'll not now or no other day
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
But I wish there was something you would do or say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
That I done it the way
For them that must obey authority
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
I send you all my money
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
If I don't take the chance to try
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
So I run down most hurriedly
Don't you tell Henry
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
And the only tune my guitar could play
Though I'd never say
But you can never steal away
We banged the drum slowly
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
My ears hear a symphony
She smiles, walks the other way
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
For them that think death's honesty
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
So, I'm walking down your highway
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But I can't deny
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
And for His love they took His life away
Maggie says that many say
And the ladies treat me kindly
So they took him to the infirmary
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Or if you just want some company
I did not do it harmfully
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Is worth more than I could pay
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
She starts to speak, but he walks away
And I'm leaving every day to run away
From phony jealousy
And it's up to you to say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
A cock is crowing far away
That I was just a puppet in a play
My mind weaves a symphony
The Spanish-American War had its day
The same thing I would want today
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
She knocked upon it anyway
She puts it to me plain as day
Well, I saw it advertised one day
And that which you've given me today
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Went to the doctor the very next day
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
To those condemned to act accordingly
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
They crammed me back into the county jail –

It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –

I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –

Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –

Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
You will not hear a laugh –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
First degree and second degree –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Indians camp along her border –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Whispering your secret emotion –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
All that foreign oil – American soil –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Remember me to one who lives there –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
To know where you are –
Hang out the whole next day –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
I got no idea what I want –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Private reasons – great or small –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
I long to hold you in the night –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Ten thousand miles or more –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
I'm sure it was not three –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
I hope that you can hear––
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
As suicide remarks are torn –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Disconnect these cables––
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
How badly they were shocked –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Oh, my–
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Leave all the children home –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Turn, turn, turn again –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Havanagee–luh–
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Haven't seen her since that night –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Ha–va–
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Hava–na–
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
