They got away!
Goodnight!

All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!

She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Dance!

Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Alright, now!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Oh, no!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
It was the mailman!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
I wanna be yours!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
How they ever flood my soul!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
He punched me out!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Howdy, East Orange!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
Woo-hoo!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
I've got the freight train blues!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Thank you!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Good God!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Oh!
Looking for my lo and behold!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Lordy, Lord!
She's insane!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Start over!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Yippee!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
You must think I'm crazy!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
My God, they killed Him!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
I got the freight train blues!
They was all over!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
I've got a million friends!
Take me down to California, baby!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
So long, New York!
Hope I don't find out too much!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Oh, yeah!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Betty Ross!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Alright!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"I've had too much of your company,"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
He said, "Tell me about it."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
It's all for the love of thee."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
And punched my cigarette."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
We'll both go off together."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
"Is it easy to forget?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I'll see her soon, I know."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
We'll both go home together."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
You must know about my debutante."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
They look as white as snow."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And have it on Highway 61."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
That you must always first forgive them."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You can't blame me at all."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I can't find my knees."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
And hung on a willow tree."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Will mourn for your return."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
I'll bring back my lady."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Would kill a little bird like me."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
I love far better than thee."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
You and I'll never know."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Have it on Highway 61."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Tangled up in blue."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Where you and I will unite."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
They look as dark as night."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
And pretend that you never have met."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"That way down Highway 61."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Come flowing down so free?"
And keep him good company."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
I'll endow them onto thee."
I would want again tomorrow."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Get on your horse and ride away."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
But I know what you want."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
We want folksingers here."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
I didn't see you around."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
God said, "On Highway 61."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
But we were tangled up in blue."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
So write to her tenderly."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Country'll grow."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
You can't blame us at all."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
For the politician's gain,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Don't you tell Henry,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Icicles hanging down,
Stripping away at it all,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Bringing me all of your charms,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
You will be alright, girl,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
I should have left this town this morning,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Keep a clean nose,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Or have done something wrong,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Don't let me drift too far,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
The train leaves at half past ten,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Get dressed, get blessed,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
For his age he is wise,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
And the whole world is on your case,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
You wanna drown love,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
They say every man must need protection,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
And you make love just like a woman,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
If'n you don't know by now,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Going, going, gone,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Had no one to go my bail,
Watch the river flow,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Far past the frozen leaves,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
True love of mine,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Searching high, searching low,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Adiós, mi corazón,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
It's like I ain't here,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
To your tambourine in time,
Well, I don't mind dying,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Heart of mine, be still,
Out to the windy beach,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Of ancient history,
But you're doing it again,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
In the turning of twilight,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Each time we meet, love,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
By rivers of blindness,
The angels play on their horns all day,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I won't have my nature way,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
It could even be like a myth,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
That her father was going to hang,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Not the end, not the end,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
And the point is slick,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
One by one they followed the sun,
Under the microscope,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Ye shall be changed,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Read books and repeat quotations,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
When there is no more,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
The path you've endured has been rough,
But evidently she don't,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
When the night comes falling,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
How he died nobody could say,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
In the little church a-this side of town,
If ever I prove false to you,
Baby, please stop crying,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Want you so bad,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Nothing was delivered,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
That you'd have liked me to,
Why she did go,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
I wish tonight were here,
That one doctor cannot save him,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Can't find what I need,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
You don't have to feed me,
Honey, just for you to climb,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Ain't no going back,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
God knows how to make it flow,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
But, if you want me to,
Corrina, Corrina,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
The human mind can only stand so much,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
I got no place left to turn,
To be on your own,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I can change, I swear,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
I'm so glad,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Badge out, laid off,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
She got great big hind legs,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Watered-down love,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Friends with you,
So unknown,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
It's rising up above my head,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I went down where the vultures feed,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Eh, singing just for you,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Tell her not to worry,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Someone to close his heart,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
She's the worst you could ever have,
A worried man with a worried mind,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Love don't have any place,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Looking for a new fool,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
In the shadows of moonlight,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
This situation can only get rougher,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
I shall be released,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
But the bottles are done,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
There's always someone who understands,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
My love, she speaks softly,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
God knows it's outta sight,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
It still ain't me, babe,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
If today was not a crooked highway,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Saved,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
For the wise men and the fools,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Don't ever try to change me,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
You could look at it and weep,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Face full of black soot,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
You can stick your head in the sand,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
God sees it all unfold,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
He is centuries old,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Well, there ain't no going back,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
You can run down to the desert,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Far away and over the wall,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Don't let me change my heart,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Went to the station down in the yard,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
You say my kisses are not like his,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
I fell down to my bended knees,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Without ideals or violence,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Well, the job that you used to have,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Too serious to fool,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
But, it ain't me, babe,
But, if I can save you any time,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Wasn't making any great connection,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
I got my mind made up,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Carved next to his name,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
And furnish me with tape,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
All them prophets good and gone,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Don't put yourself over the line,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
The light I never knowed,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Strike another match, go start anew,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
To be without a home,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Don't matter what you did,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
The man in the trench-coat,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
And, if I can save you any time,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
When she lays upon the grass,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
I got a bird that whistles,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
I can see the turning of the key,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Pressing on,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
I get my sweet reward,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
They say every man needs protection,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Thank You, Lord,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
God knows it's true,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yes, I'm so glad,
There she come, now, down my way,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
They––they show me to the door,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
You want watered-down love,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
The day would surely have to break,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
In one the surface was frozen,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
God knows when,
All that and more and then some,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Wintertime in New York town,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
I just don't know what to do,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
And I got those worried blues,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
If she ain't feeling well,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
The wind blowing the snow around,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Well, I been gambling so long,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
They say everything can be replaced,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Every brain is civilized,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Over your senses you have no control,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
And here I sit so patiently,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Ah, get sick, get well,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
They run a brick and tile company,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
To find out if she's talked,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Going,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Hmm, I can make it through,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
My arms and legs were broken,
Winter would have no spring,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
She's crying like an evil stone,
How does it feel,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
And pretend that we never have touched,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
In the image of someone you used to know,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
And she makes love just like a woman,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Joey, Joey,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Ten thousand men on the move,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Rabbit running down across the road,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Come all without, come all within,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Like you never did before,
My woman's never sitting at home,
I went into the red, went into the black,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Loyalty, unity,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Into my own parade,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Need a woman all the time,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Analyze you, categorize you,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
In love and with kindness,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
They say every man need protection,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Now you don't talk so loud,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
I want you,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
God knows there's a purpose,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
We live and we die, we know not why,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
And all of your children start to resent you,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
A true love of mine,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
He won't do nothing to you,
And forget my pride,
I'm pledging my time to you,
I've been around this whole country,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
In the darkness of my night,
I thank the Lord,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
She said she would never forget,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I got a wife and five little children,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
The joint is jumping,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Six months on the chain gang,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Love that's pure no accident,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Up and down the block,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Honey, I will meet you there,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
So, never leave me lonely,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
To have––be on your own,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
In the lonely night,
You have given all there is to give,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Hang around the ink-well,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
When I seen him lose control,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
If you can't quit your sinning,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I want you so bad,
And gathering storms may arise,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Don't let her know,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
I try my best to be like I am,
The one we can see and can feel,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
If you'd see me this way,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
That two healers cannot heal him,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I rambled out of New York town,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
I try my best to be just like I am,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
She's opened up a happy home,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
All the tired horses in the sun,
You better chew gum,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
And point away from the past,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Equality, liberty,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Oh, singing just for you,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
With the juice running down my leg,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
As the present now will later be past,
I just say no thanks,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
And every cause that ever I fought,
The only son of God Almighty,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I can make it through,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
May be living in another country under another name,
Dream about you, baby,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
And played the fife lowly,
The air is getting hotter,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
May be an actor in a plot,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Look out, kid,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Maybe when we both get sober,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Neither one gonna turn and run,
When I was in Missouri,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
The winter would hold no spring,
Far away from it all,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Over the hills and far away,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Drag you down or drain you down,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
More people kept a-piling on,
And I'm in the shade,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
And I'm just like that bird,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
And she aches just like a woman,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Broken threads, broken springs,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Got my mind made up,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Puffing on a big cigar,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
I've been saved – well, alright,
It was from her ship sailing,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Said I'm pressing on,
The country doctor rambles,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
He's not selling any alibis,
You're beautiful to me,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
And think they're fooling you,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Get back, write Braille,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
By losers, cheaters,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
To a solid rock,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I'd only have to stay,
Something about you that I can't shake,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I just can't beg you anymore,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
And I got the worried blues,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
She'll surely turn to white,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
All you can do is do what you must,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Just like I did before,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Precious angel under the sun,
Madams light the candles,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
With his candle lit into the sun,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Father of night, father of day,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
As I travel down life's pathway,
God knows it's terrifying,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
I never can go because, you know,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
The sky too is folding under you,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Get jailed, jump bail,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
And your streets are getting empty,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
The Second World War came to an end,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
The carpet too is moving under you,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Hmm, see what you can do,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
To shine in through,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Mercury, gravity,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
But he can't be blamed,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
But he's the property of Jesus,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Well, I'm so glad,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
And it's like I ain't here,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
She once was a true love of mine,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Thieving in the alley,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Make you spin or do you in,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
You to me were true,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Two by two they step in the dark,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Laying low,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Went back home to the yard,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
God knows it's fragile,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Advertising signs, they con,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Like as not, it's better so,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
I threw it all away,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Well, I may just swear,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
A hand set the spark,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Seven days,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
I had no one for to go my bail,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
As his youth now unfolds,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Till both of us fell by the way,
In his anger and his shame,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
And the sooner you come up with them,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
My existence led by confusion boats,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
When all will be well,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
While paupers change possessions,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Three angels up above the street,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
People carry roses,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
With no direction home,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Strangers all give me the news,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Staying far behind without you,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
I couldn't see where we were going,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
To hang and to lynch,
Father of minutes, father of days,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
On the stone that remains,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Look away, you rolling river,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
We never much thought we could get very old,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Is looking for a new fool,
I want my arms around you,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
God knows there's a river,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Oh, watered-down love,
Bring the wife and family,
God knows you've got to weep,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Resent him to the bone,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
If your time to you is worth saving,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
A million faces at my feet,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Better jump down a manhole,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Yet every distance is not near,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Stand up straight and tall,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
She'll be coming forth,
My woman needs it every day,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
To be so useless and all,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
God knows there's a heaven,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Day you quit me, baby,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
True love, they've been without it,
She leave by the other and roam,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
You got something I want plenty of,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
And not going through any great extreme,
Just as long as you stay with me,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
And you take just like a woman,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Stone you and say good luck,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
In the ruins of your balcony,
I been good while I been waiting,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
For she ain't the same,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
A complete unknown,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
I got the worried blues,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Don't let her know that you love her,
She said she would always stay,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
One by one they follow the sun,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Too noble to neglect,
Where I will always be renewed,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Someone to open each and every door,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
You can hear them tires squeal,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Without your sweet love,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
It always means so much,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
I got those worried blues,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Serve somebody,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Stone you just like they said they would,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
I know I can't win,
To be one your own,
Far away in the stormy night,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Give you my money, honey,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Had a dream about you, baby,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Don't let her hear,
And, although that we're single and free,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Precious father, loving mother,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
I need a shot of love,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I just keep pressing on,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Eh, see what you can do,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
And it ain't me, babe,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
That must be what it's all about,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Like a rolling stone,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Don't let her see,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
If not for you,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
One summer's day he came passing by,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
God knows you ain't pretty,
I'm gonna let you pass,
First to come in was the flying moth,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
They keep it all hid,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Go away from my window,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Tell me that you love me only,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I bless the day I found you,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
And, if I see the day,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Try hard, get barred,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Now, won't you tell me true,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Thinking about the government,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
See you fly or watch you die,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Who could they get to carry you,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Searching everywhere I know,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
But, to remain as friends,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
King of the streets, child of clay,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
You had enough of hatred,
But it would not be new,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Don't let her see that you need her,
I don't care if you analyze me,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
You and me, we had completeness,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
With his fist in a clinch,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
You find God in the church of your choice,
For her to arrive,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
The night passed away so quickly,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
How many a year has passed and gone,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
God don't call it treason,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Vanished from my hand,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Father of day, father of night,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
For something that he never done,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Trust yourself,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
You made it there somehow,
It all seemed so well-timed,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Carry the New York Times,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Get born, keep warm,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
With what your fate is going to be,
Each one playing a horn,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Speaking to some French girl,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Without a love of my own,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
But, deep inside my heart,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
I would not feel so all alone,
Don't follow leaders,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Memory, ecstasy,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Made before the foundation of the world,
In the hills of mystery,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Since you've been gone,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
No, nothing was delivered,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Don't know what to do without it,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
That can do what's never been done,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
To be––direction home,
Don't let yourself fall,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
While riding on a train going west,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I went down to scrub and rub,
The kingdoms of experience,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
But, if I will save you the time,
My limbs are shaking,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Don't try No Doz,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
You have given me life to live,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Nothing too very scientific,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Front door shut, back door too,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
In the great unknown,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Without a dream in my heart,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
The day you quit me, baby,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Circled by the circus sands,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Or select you or dissect you,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
You were snow, you were rain,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Father of air and father of trees,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
And I'm back in the rain,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
And to come every time you call,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Never weak, but always strong,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
It was you who came right through,
I'd give you the sky high above,
For all intended purposes,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
That five walls cannot hide him,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
I went into the city, into the town,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
I have no one to meet,
Tell me,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Who will promise never to part,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
She never does me wrong,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
But it ain't me, babe,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Father of black, father of white,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
You married young just like your ma,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
This place ain't doing me any good,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
She would have married me,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
If you must cling to someone,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
I wish I a-was a magician,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
It's really something,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
And also by his feet,
It always has hit me from below,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
I can't understand,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Well, get sick, get well,
God knows there's a chance,
I been riding the midnight train,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Already the fiesta has begun,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Watching the river flow,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
The midnight rain follows the train,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
To be alone with you,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
I been good,
China doll, alcohol,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Go down to the river, babe,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Just remember that death is not the end,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
God knows it's a crime,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
You got something better,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
To be out on your own,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
On this new morning, new morning,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
And come every time you call,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Like a dog on a chain,
You better duck down the alleyway,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Judge and jury took their stand,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
So I got those worries blues,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Of this I can't say very much,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
You have explained every mystery,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
But something has changed,
Beating for the dead that rise,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
People talk of situations,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Never needed to call you my whore,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
I swung on to my old guitar,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Well, I can't understand,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
The country music station plays soft,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Don't tie no bows,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Don't wanna be a bum,
You have given me eyes to see,
To keep up his hate,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
"Come along and take a trip,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
To gather flowers constantly,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Made of silver or of golden,
From their fates try to resign,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Keep me where you are,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
You were striped, you were plain,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
A foreign sound to your ear,
It's alright,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
People talk over situations,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Mixing up the medicine,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Like some mystery,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Light yourself a candle,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
All the silver, all the gold,
Just don't know what to do,
Automobile coming into style,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Don't wear sandals,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
I'll be on my way,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
You'll change your last name, too,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Broken treaties, broken vows,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
And may you stay forever young,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Just then the order came to charge,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
In a pine box for all eternity,
I had so much left to do,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
And give him back the time he's done,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
That four ears cannot hear him,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I once held her in my arms,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Is it really any wonder,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I'm leaving today,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
People are crazy, times are strange,
He been around the world and back again,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
You have given everything to me,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
See her in that very tight skirt,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Oh, see what you can do,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
And to come each time you call,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
I'm going down the river,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
They must bust in early May,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Try to be a success,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
That long, black train is pulling down,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Silhouetted by the sea,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
They say every distance is not near,
I'd already gone the distance,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
I'd be sad and blue,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Got me a secret membership card,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Aim well, my little one,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Makes no difference where she's been,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Every head is so dignified,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
"Not me," said his manager,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
And I know what you're thinking of,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Better jump down the manhole,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Father who build the mountain so high,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I got two white horses following me,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
The man there said he loved my sound,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Three by three they're turning the key,
And there's two white horses following me,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
You broke a heart that loved you,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
You stole her love from me one day,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Well, the way I love that woman,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
God knows that, when you see it,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
That foreign sound in your ear,
You gotta look some other place,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
New morning,
He's young and on fire,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
You always responded when I needed your help,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Living in the land of Nod,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
When you think that you've lost everything,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
We'll fly the night away,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
And I'm so glad,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Ever since I been a child,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Newspapermen eating candy,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
A thousand miles from home,
I'm never, never far from home,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
I march in the parade of liberty,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
So glad,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
But now morning is clear,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
I long to see you in the morning light,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Looking 'bout the government,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
I can't be good, baby,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Grandpa died last week,
That fellow who never blushes,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
If I didn't have to guess,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
To protect his white skin,
To stay closer than any friend,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Oh, in somebody's room,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
This world is ruled by violence,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
One by one until there were none,
No direction home,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Drifting too far from shore,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
To strict party-platform ties,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
You got to serve somebody,
You need something to open your eyes,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
At the close of the day,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
But I know that he don't talk,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
They say every man must fall,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
The beat is pumping,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
They don't believe in mercy,
The night blows cold and rainy,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Want you,
It's too bad he had to go,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
How he died nobody can say,
And on the highway of regret,
Look who's back in town,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Whether you are right or wrong,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Broken idols, broken heads,
A dream about you, baby,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Relationships of ownership,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Gonna serve somebody,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Well, well, well,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
That the laws are with him,
It's not aimed at anyone,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
God knows everything,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
All I really wanna do,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Broken switches, broken gates,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
A question in your nerves is lit,
And, though the line is cut,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
I went out last night to take a little round,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
They tell me every man must fall,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
If anything is gonna sell,
That fired the gun,
Where life and death are memorized,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
In the instant that I preach,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
My senses have been stripped,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Heart of mine,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
The night would see me wide awake,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
But I will be back, I will survive,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Stay away from the train line,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
But it ain't him to blame,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Never did feel this way before,
He got that soft, silky skin,
You even make love just like a woman,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
God don't call it wrong,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
I love you, pretty baby,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Waiting for the trains,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
The sky too is folding over you,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
I'll go see them come down my way,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
God knows it's a struggle,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
But you were gambling for support,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
And you know I could never be your own,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Simplify you, classify you,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
I'm going out of my mind,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Going home,
Just to know that you are near,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
My dear, sweet friend,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
But I'm saved,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
People going down to the ground,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
He's the property of Jesus,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
But you try with your whole soul,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Cares not to come up any higher,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
But I've been hanging on,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Oh, Angelina,
It's a price I have to pay,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
May be the head of some big TV network,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
But I'm pressing on,
In the end,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
May you stay forever young,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
First degree and second degree,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
They say that every man must fall,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Just like a rolling stone,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
They lowered him down as a king,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
By users, cheaters,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Going, going,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
With a killer's pride, security,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Trouble,
Is used, it is plain,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Ooh, watered-down love,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
A man with a badge skips by,
Pick you up every time you fall,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
And, if anybody asks me,
Broken hands on broken plows,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
They pass by so silently,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Like a complete unknown,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
I think we better talk this over,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Dust on my face and my cape,
If you throw it all away,
"Not I," said the referee,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
We take great delight in our own company,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Don't let her see where you're going,
You've got to serve somebody,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
It hurts me, too,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
It don't matter what you did,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Go melt back in the night,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Yes, and I'll go last,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
We live in a political world,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Using every angle under the sun,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Hazel, you called and I came,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
You need something to open up a new door,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Every nerve is analyzed,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Ye shall be a-changed,
We've killed each one,
To know how much I really care,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
But the time ain't tall,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Forever young, forever young,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Broken lines, broken strings,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
You can raise up your right hand,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
And she'll be coming forth,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
They walk among the stately trees,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Private reasons, great or small,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Democracy don't rule the world --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
That's where you belong --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
And one day he came passing by.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Nobody stops to ask why.
You don't have to be afraid.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Have fallen from her curls.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Just what he was talking about.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Unless they're from another world.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Friends with you.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Under the hedges.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
To anything I might've tried.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
In the palace of the Pope.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
In the border-towns of despair.
Just remember that death is not the end.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
For as long as love will last.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
While my conscience explodes.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
I need a shot of love.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Patriotism, materialism.
Come on, honey.
They would not let me be.
He's always on trial for just being born.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Is what this thing here is for.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Last radio is playing.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Watch the parking meters.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Saying wants company.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
I shall be released.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
You got a heart of stone.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
Nobility, humility.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
You're a big girl now.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Blowing through another no-good town.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Go lightly on the ground.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
I find it so difficult to leave.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
To know which way the wind blows.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
I got nothing left to burn.
They found him dead in the street one day.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
"Don't trill no news on me.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.

When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
She can't find him anywhere.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Right now I'm having trouble.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
And it never seemed strange.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
See that my grave is kept clean.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
So long, honey babe.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Who always was too proud to beg.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
The stores one by one, they're folding.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
She acts like we never met.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Epitome, rigidity.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
After losing every battle.
For she once was a true love of mine.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
To live it you had to explode.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
But I would never do you wrong.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
New morning.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
And the morning will be breaking.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
It was a normal day.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
And ye shall be changed.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
And the mailbox is locked.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
I stood wondering which way to go.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Thought I was a communist.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Means another poor boy is underground.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
An innocent man in a living hell.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
It's just the old American way.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Some speak of the future.
And I need you, yeah.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
I can't fire them anymore.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
I got a bird that sings.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
He could die happily ever after.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
The light I never knowed.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
I scarcely feel the glow.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Heart of mine.
Funny way to start a picnic.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
But you're not even sure what it is.
While the law looks the other way.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Tell me that it isn't true.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
But with the country to where you're going.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Till your error you clearly learn.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
But he sure left here in style.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
In an oil refinery.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Step lightly on the ground.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
I been worrying about you, baby.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
At not getting their money's worth.
From my toes up to my ears.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
And your highway's getting filled.
Rain would gather, too.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
In fond memory appear.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
That keep us so tightly bound.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Life don't mean a thing.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Billy, you been running for so long.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
It would go up against every rule.
As if a wedding vow.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
I see that stationmaster too.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
And discovered her invisible self.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
I can't see through it anymore.
It always does when you're with me.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Where teardrops fall.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
My love, she speaks softly.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
You have no idea what you do to me.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
The whole world is my throne.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
There's no words that need to be said.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
When you made everybody pay.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
Magic in a magical land.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Please let me ride you home.
And then go on home and have my fun.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
And watch the parking meters.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Using ideas as my maps.
Who says she knows me well.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
That last night I was with.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Orders from the D.A.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Honey, I never would have come.
Baby, two feet from the well.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Lay your hand upon my head.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
She said she would always stay.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Said it was a bad dream.
You'll never see me frown.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
'Steada acting like we never met.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
When he played and we didn't dance.
I want you.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
I'm not the one you need.
Everybody must get stoned.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I remember her whispering yet.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
And gives it to me for a song.
In the night the price was paid.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
And you must realize the danger.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
But I can't get close to her at all.
To the old folks' home and the college.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
A-lord, protect my child.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
But these to tell what's true.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Headed out for the western skies.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Know not what the years may hold.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
And keep away from pranks.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
By the saving grace that's over me.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Gonna serve somebody.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
When my working day's through.
Hoping you'll come through too.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
See him at play makes me smile.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
To anything I might have tried.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Most of the time.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
On the caboose of the train.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
And I want you to be that woman.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Now and forever let it be me.
Hope you're ready.
Close your eyes, close the door.
Go find out something only dead men know.
You'll do as much for me.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Her fond face pale with woe.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
But I never yet found Fennario.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
And crime don't have a face.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
And I've never been too impressed.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
They want me for a gambling fight.
And each one I've never seen again.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Hope I don't blow it.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
That can win what's never been won.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
To anything I mighta tried.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Girls like birds fly away.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.

Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
And I was brought up by my brother.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Tangled up in blue.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
People bending broken rules.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
At my window with a broken wing.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
The National Guard stands around the door.
It don't matter, anyhow.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Turned on my record player.
I just can't see through it anymore.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
To kill with no pain.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
Crying out that he was framed.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
My baby told me I would have to go.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.

A-move a-lightly on the ground.
At the sorority sisters' home.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.

Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
That brave and devoted band.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.

I did not do it knowingly.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
For your times, they are a-changing.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.

Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
68, but says she's 24.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Broken voices on broken phones.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.

A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.

And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Six by six...
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
In the pale moonlight.

Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

It only brings me sorrow.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
And that failure's no success at all.
Chain you down or be your clown.

In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.

Bid farewell forever.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.

Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
All my connections too.

A lover for your life and nothing more.

In my Cadillac.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
It ain't quite the end.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.

But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
I needed somebody to talk to.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
If not for you.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Never been so easy or so slow.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
They seem determined to go all the way.
To see that you're madly in love.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Tell me.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
And I'll rock you too.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Without a love of my own.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
But the mountains of the past.
You're my baby.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Madams light the candles.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Well, I'm just thumping.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Yes, tell me.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
There was nobody around.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
And come away with me.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
I'll remember you.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Or define you or confine you.
I can't use it anymore.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
Father of love and father of rain.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
He went down to Oxford Town.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
That I left in the French Quarter.
As the present now will later be past.
I'd like to know.
To be alone with you.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
I hate bears.
Under the midnight moon.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
"And light on my right knee.
Walking around with no one else.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
So many people I never saw in my life.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Than people who are most content.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Take me as I am or let me go.
You can make it too.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
"Get well, get well," said she.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
But you break just like a little girl.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Can't see over to the other side.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Even before you came in the door.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
The place that I started from.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
And she had left him to die in there.
If I ride back again.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
Honey, come and see about me.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
May you stay forever young.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Even the softest touch.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
I can't shoot them anymore.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Until I threw it all away.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
We were the wrong side.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Mortality, reality.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
I never saw the man again.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Blues wrapped around my head.
That I really did try to get close to you.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Honey, baby.
In this concrete world full of souls.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
If you won't come out your window.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
It runs both cold and deep.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
See like me or be like me.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
A foreign sound to your ear.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
I'm just average, common too.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Down to New Orleans.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Just you and me.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
You're the only love I've ever known.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
What some people are gonna do for money.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Everything inside is made of stone.
The whole night through.
The night will soon be gone.
Come over here from over there, girl.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
At the end of the trail.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
For the times, they are a-changing.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Everybody's having them dreams.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Tried to create a next world war.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
If you throw it all away.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
That's the way I remember her best.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Up and down the lonesome town.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Don't remember one thing more.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
All because his face was brown.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
And disregards the rest.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
But the fighter still remains.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Crying out that he been framed.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Foundationed deep somehow.
You may not see me tomorrow.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
I'll hold it down for you.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
And then unto eternity.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Or stay all night with thee.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
And it is time for me to slide.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
In the summertime when you were with me.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Drifting too far from shore.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
And guarded them as they fell.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
To make me think I'm wrong.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
And laid his life on the line.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
He never did know what it was all about.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
All because of the color of his skin.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Baby, please come home.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
And I need you, ah.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Rode slowly back again.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
That set everybody free.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Like you never done before.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Precious memories flood my soul.
And the Santa Fe.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Memories of what used to be.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
You don't have to worry any more.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
The last radio is playing.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Living down Sonora way.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
It's that million dollar bash.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
I would only let you down.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
Someone's watching over you.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
But my heart just won't give in.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
The sooner you can leave.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Crumble into one another.
Some place so high above this wall.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
He gone north for a while.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
God knows...
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Need that woman straight and true.
Or put up against the wall.
You're my honey.
Lost time is not found again.
Finalize you or advertise you.
And he was a friend of mine.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
His voice was low with pain.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Come on, baby...
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
I know they're not what they seem.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Just crying out that he was framed.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
But you're back where you belong.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
A true love of mine.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Come on, darling.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
High society, notoriety.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
I had something to protect.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Now they say it's the land of money.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
For an instant hand touched hand.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Oh, yes, they did.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
You'd better get that in your head.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Throw my ticket out the window.
What you'll say when you get home.
She saw her father's body broken.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
I'm a poet, I know it.
They both rode off together.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Never will want for money.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.

About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
With all these promises you left for me.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
And shot it fulla holes.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
And they gotta cut something.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
That Johanna's not here.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
To hold me in your arms.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Wants to get it paid off.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Just to take somebody's money away.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
If you just let me come home with you.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
You got it, baby.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But it was more than I could do.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
The next day could be your last.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
The words that her lover had said.
She murdered mortal he.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.

So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
And the sails are spread.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.

I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.

And rivers that ran through every day.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
And light on your right knee.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.

There were six thousand people there.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.

And the dust of rumors covers me.
I just go pump on it some.
Look a-the other way.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
She pretends like we never have met.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Honey, I want you.

In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
I froze right to the bone.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.

Up the steps into the nearest bank.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.

Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Is tearing up your mind.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Is gonna be against the law.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
And try to avoid the scandals.
You want a watered-down love.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Adiós, mi corazón.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
You won't get it for money.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
People sleeping in broken beds.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Fear to bring children into the world.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Got my mind made up.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Everything is broken.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
"Don't point your finger at me.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
But you were tangled up in blue.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
I got nothing to go back to now.
And I's left alone with three children.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
That must be what it's all about.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
And get something quick to eat.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
To the sin of love's false security.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
You sound like a hillbilly.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
I followed the winding stream.
You only got ten.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
You can't win with a losing hand.
You're a big girl all the way.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
So quickly into autumn.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Duality, mortality.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
I know something is changed.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Going, going, gone.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
You break your promise all over the place.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Oh, Angelina.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
I didn't realize how young you were.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Come on, baby.
What looks like the easy way out.
Ever since I seen you there.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
Everything is gonna be alright.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
That number eleven was closing.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
We may not make it through the night.
Valentines can't buy her.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Dollar a day's worth.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Someone I really could care for.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
You're too hot, darling.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Oh, her darling love she found.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
The National Guard stands around his door.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Going back where we come from.
I know you always say that you agree.
Baby, baby...
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
"And stay all night with me.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I want everybody to be free.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Without ideals or violence.
My baby stole my heart from me.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
I had so little time to fail.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
The hour when the ship comes in.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Hmm, tell me.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Ever since I seen her smile.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Suffering like a fool.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
And the people that confronted him were many.
I think this time we should escape.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
The time and the place that we'd part.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Got ice water in my veins.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
I once held her in my arms.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Figuring a way to get back home.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
I'm younger than that now.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
That linger in the fireball heat.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
And tapestry of rhyme.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
He's got his mother's eyes.
I'll only let you down.
Of every man who put me here.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Sweet lady.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
I long to reach for you in the night.
You left me standing out in the cold.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
To which a scoundrel clings.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Just what this song is all about.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
Trying to create a next world war.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Is just equality in school.
Some place so high above the wall.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
It sure is right on a night like this.
His enemies say he's on their land.
My baby took my heart from me.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
You were always so close and still within reach.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
And make promises by the hours.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
I used to care, but things have changed.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
And wait for succeeding kings.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
I threw it all away.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Greenwich Village.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
I hope you're ready.
I just can't beg you anymore.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
For me to return to or chase.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
I only saw what they let me see.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Someone to open each and every door.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I couldn't find any.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Evidently she won't.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
So, darling, you better come through.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
And relive my dreams.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
You are on the bottom.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Lay dead beside him there.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
On this new morning with you.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
I can walk anytime around the block.
68, but says he's 24.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
I hope I'm ready.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
And say you'll always let it be me.
With your golden loom.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
And you only got ten.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
And clouds cover up the ground.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
When I'm alone with you.
I don't even know why we come.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
The same as my father before him.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
It don't matter anyhow.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Trust yourself.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Humility, simplicity.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
So the radio didn't work so well.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
It'll never do, somehow.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
When she's better only time'll tell.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Till I come into New York town:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
But there's one promise, darling:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
His epitaph plain:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Serve somebody:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Some speak of the future;
Crumble into one another;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Had to be held down by big police;
I find complete love;
So many things that we never will undo;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
All lies and jest;
Make promises by the hour;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>

<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<p>

<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>

<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?"

Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Baby, can I come home with you?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
That too many people have died?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Can you get back in?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
By golly, what more can I say?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Does anyone even try?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Like a rolling stone?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What would life be?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
How could they ever mistake you?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
When he's standing in front of you?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Just what in the world has come over you?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Oh, so why not you and me?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Before it's washed to the sea?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who killed Davey Moore?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Is it rolling, Bob?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
How can you say he will haunt you?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Does he change the course of rivers?
But who did I see but the one I love?
And one deserving of affection?
Has anybody seen my love?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
What can I give to You?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
How's everything in heaven?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
For all these earthly things?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
What's wrong with you this time?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Just like a rolling stone?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
How many paths did they try and fail?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
How can I live for You?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before it is washed to the sea?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Of everything you see?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Am I ready?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Across the swooping plain?
But am I still dreaming yet?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Gal, where you been so long?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Before he can see the sky?
Before he can hear people cry?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Did you respect me for what I did?
How many more can they afford?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Too many people have died?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
When did you leave heaven?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
What good am I?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Why would I want to take your life?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
And how does it feel?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Before they're forever banned?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Have they missed you?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
How many more without any reward?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Are you ready?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
How does it feel?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Am I still dreaming yet?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Why and what's the reason for?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
The love that a stranger might receive?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
What else can a poor boy do?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Must everybody bow?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Before you call him a man?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
How many compared to yesterday?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Where did you hide your halo?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Where did you lose your wings?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Baby, can't you tell?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
How could they let you go?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Can I come home with you?
To love and follow His direction?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Across the swamp of time?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
How much poison did they inhale?
What can I do for You?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
It was put together down in Argentina
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
By no special friend
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
She let go of my hand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
I want you, baby, just to understand
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
As I stand upon the sand
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
I've been walking around
And those whom doom and death had spared
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Silvio, silver and gold
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Nothing was delivered
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
And your trouble is you know it too good
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Somebody seen him hanging around
Maybe someday you will understand
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
You used to be so amused
To see him obviously framed
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
They took a clean-cut kid
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Many times I've often prayed
So I'll make my stand
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
I still can remember the way that you smiled
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
You used––be so proud
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
There ain't nothing in this world
Now you don't act so––so proud
Standing on the water, casting your bread
"Equality". I spoke the word
I thought that it was well-understood
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For what you sold that's not been received
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
But all that suffering was not to be compared
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Just what you had in mind
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
All the sweethearts you can hold
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Its iron claws attached
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Now you don't seem so proud
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Things would be different the next time we wed
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
How many times can a man turn his head
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
I run right home and I went to bed
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
He was a clean-cut kid
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I'll always thank the Lord
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Now, a very great man once said
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
While some, on principles baptized
And that even the nobles get properly handled
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Now, whenever I get up and
I live in another world
But she ain't gonna find the road
But something has changed
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
We live in a political world
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
You try so hard, but you don't understand
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
I will not go down under the ground
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
But now something has changed
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
And then you told me later as I apologized
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
And into the path you are hurled
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
It's something you did
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
And things would be different the next time we wed
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Con you into thinking that you're the one
You just pick anyone
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
She knows there's no success like failure
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Breaking hearts up and down the line
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
You're not free to belong to me
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Remember me to one who lives there
At dawn my lover comes to me
Everybody's wearing a disguise
I been wondering all about me
Up into some paradise
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Little did I realize
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Lies that life is black-and-white
But I feel nothing for their game
On the rising curve
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
There were times when I was so lonesome
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Limited in sex they dare
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
But I can't say I sympathize
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Hunger pays a heavy price
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
And that is that one must always flush out his house
The crashing waves roll over me
Says it's closing time
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Where I could watch her waltz for free
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
While them that defend what they cannot see
You smiling through the fence at me
You said you'd never compromise
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
I can survive and I can endure
I'm ready for to fade
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
As he rises to fame
To give the special one you seek a chance
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
So up she picked her babies three
He'll see by his grave
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
But I can get another one
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Leaving men wholly, totally free
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
It'll be with me unto the grave
You say you're looking for someone
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Though its shadow's metal badge
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
You know, it's not even safe no more
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
And I'm just the same as anyone else
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Among the lovely people living free
"That I might be gone a long, old time
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
You cut to the core
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
And I would send a message
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
If dogs run free, why not me
We see this empty cage now corrode
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
If dogs run free, then what must be
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
And I ain't complaining none
What good am I then to others and me
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Should I leave them by your gate
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
But the dark does die
So I remember every face
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
What's probably got you baffled more
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
A bed that is never mine
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Knows there's no success like failure
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Taking care of somebody nice
Why wait any longer for the one you love
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Full of hope and desire
All I feel is heat and flame
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
From all the plans they do pursue
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
With all memory and fate
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
I'm sure you're the one to blame
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Should I put them by your gate
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
How many ears must one man have
That she's the same one
Remember me to the one who lives there
Looking at hands for the lines that were
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
See the primitive wallflower freeze
She been gone
The man the authorities came to blame
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Well, it's all new to me
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Just what you will say when you get home
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
When the rain is blowing in your face
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
It's all new to me
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
When the roses fade
How was I to know you'd be the one
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
The cause was there before we came
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
She plunged him into well water where
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Most of the time I can't even be sure
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And you see why it's so unique to be
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Feel to moan, but unlike before
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And suddenly there appeared before me
They say don't come back no more
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
"It's only you that he does crave
You into thinking you're the one
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Mona tried to tell me
Better stay away from those
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
I am homeless, come and take me
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
What about that millionaire
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
From the start by the rule
So, I called up the operator of time
But it won't be over till they clear his name
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
And the Negro's name
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
I rode with him in a taxi once
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Waiting to find out what price
If dogs run free, why not we
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
I don't even notice she gone
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
When I'm all alone
To show you something you seen before
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
I do declare
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
What you're gonna say when you get home
Just pick anyone
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
And never sat once at the head of the table
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
So I look like a walking mountain range
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
Oh, trust yourself
And the cards are no good that you're holding
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
For your weary toes to be touching
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Beyond here lies nothing
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
If I was with her too long
For your weary toes to be a-touching
The order is a-rapidly fading
The order is rapidly fading
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Early in the morning, early in the morning
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
The battle outside raging
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Where the time and the tempo drag
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
'Cause the battle outside raging
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Deceived me into thinking
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
They're drinking up and walking
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
It's not a bad way to make a living
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
But then a whistle will be blowing
She rode by night and came by morning
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
There's nothing in here moving
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Then she told us how times were tough
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Look out, the saints are coming through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I have fallen far beneath
Girls' faces formed the forward path
And how I know I'll make it through
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Make everything from toy guns that spark
You turn around to take a final peek
But they caught him and they brought him back
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Her voice once and talk
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
I wish she'd unlock
The man in me will do nearly any task
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Shoot in the back
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Well, there ain't no going back
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
A girl by the whirlpool
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Then why don't she tell
They ask me how I feel
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Muttering small talk at the wall
And if my love is real
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
I chased me a woman up the hill
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
He's taught in his school
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
How many seas must a white dove sail
Oh, how does it feel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Ring bar, hard to tell
But among the dead that were left on the hill
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
He's sure got a lot of gall
Soul to soul our shadows roll
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
A-how does it feel
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
To make all that should be killed to crawl
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Well, if I die on top of the hill
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
How many seas must the white dove sail
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
All and all can only fall
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Ring bell, hard to tell
How does it feel
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
"For you cannot relive them
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Two eyes took the aim
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
And remain as I am
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
You better not chew gum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
But I can hear another drum
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, I'm hanging on
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
She said that all the railroad men
He got that fortress on the mountain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
And you ache a-just like a woman
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
And she wakes just like a woman
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
In the pigpen
And the corner sign
Guns and clubs followed him down
That long, black train is pulling on down
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
You take just like a woman
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
How many roads must a man walk down
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Why did you trade heaven
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Yet I swear I see my reflection
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
That long, black train is pulling down
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
You need something to make it known
Somebody new to beat on
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And she aches just like a woman
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
I figure maybe we're even
Advertising signs that con
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
The next morning she had awoken
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
All their daughters put me down
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
She takes just like a woman
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
And the smell of their roses does not remain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Uncle Rat went running downtown
The foreign sun, it squints upon
For the loser now might be later to win
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, you fake just like a woman
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Trying to get a lead on
But the post office has been stolen
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Their religion of the little ten women
Out of the shower comes a football man
To remember the times when I was your only man
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
But me, I expected it to happen
And all their daughters put me down
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
And there's no exit in any direction
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Must meet the dawn
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Darkness at the break of noon
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
You don't need a weatherman
But it's hard to think on
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
She got such a sweet disposition
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
How can the life of such a man
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
To my knowledge there's just one man
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
For the loser now will be later to win
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Will not be understood as they're spoken
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
But I swear I see my reflection
Suicide remarks are torn
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
But all their daughters put me down
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
All lay down their bandanas and complain
"Not me," said the gambling man
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
The ones that jump on the wagon
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
I'll be waiting at the station
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
But the second mom was with the seventh son
I don't even care if I ever see her again
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Nothing we can call our own
From heights that they could not gain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Yes, and someone must explain
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Have died in battle or in vain
My love, she's like some raven
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
A-she takes just like a woman
All I really wanna do
Every place I wanna go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
There's nothing you can say or do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All I'd like you to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
There is a place you go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Silvio, I gotta go
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
How many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
The man in the coon-skin cap
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
I walked down there and ended up
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Man in the coon-skin cap
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
What good am I while you softly weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Aladdin and his lamp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
I close my eyes and I wonder
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Alone you stand with nobody near
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
So, don't fear if you hear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
My ship is in the harbor
Never no more do I wonder
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
At any moment you could go under
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
For I am married to a house carpenter
The wind howls like a hammer
I could feel a whole lot better
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
You heard me saying a prayer for
All you boys better run for cover
The face of God will appear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
The lover who has just walked out your door
Still I say her love-words over
Who came here from Cuba's door
And I don't even think about her
In one I was running and in another
She took him by his long, yellow hair
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
I don't have to go far
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Still I've always kind of missed her
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
When only you are near
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
I say, "Why you say that for
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
When you whispered in my ear
But morning is clear
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
For all eternity I think I will remember
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Her window's wide open, African trees
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And tells me of her dreams
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
On the back of the fish truck that loads
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
To memorizing politics
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Statues made of matchsticks
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
How many deaths will it take till he knows
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
But still remains
I'm gonna let you pass
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
They whisper in the wings
At times I think there are no words
With a big bouquet of the roses
People carry roses
He's not selling any alibis
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And, though the masters make the rules
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Six-time losers
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Six-time users
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
What good am I if I say foolish things
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And I try to harmonize with songs
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the poor white remains
And your father, to your sister he explains
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
That it's you and no one else that owns
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Girl by the whirlpool's
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
But, though the masters make the rules
Don't wear sandals
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
People on the platforms
Thinking of a series of dreams
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Glide across the lonely years
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Mama, you know, awaits the news
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
True love can make a blade of grass
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
I'd gladly confess
Don't follow leaders
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
To the cutting of fences
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And so Patty calls the cops
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
You should be made to wear earphones
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
And then complains
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Well, the ragman draws circles
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
The cowboy angel rides
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Good and bad, I define these terms
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Romantic facts of musketeers
To sharpen the senses
Now, you must provide some answers
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You been hurt so many times
As friends and other strangers
I try to tell it like it is
You know that he has no intentions
Seven days
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
The empty-handed painter from your streets
We living in times when men commit crimes
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
You can fall down on your knees
And the princess and the prince discuss
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
When your mother sends back all your invitations
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
You never turned around to see the frowns
I was thinking of a series of dreams
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Wants eleven dollar bills
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
In the stillness of the midnight
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Keep me set apart
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Someday, everything is gonna be different
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
How many years can a mountain exist
By the way, that's a cute hat
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
You used to laugh–make fun about
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
In the precious winds they rot
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
And I, in my armor, turning about
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
With your pockets well protected at last
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Everyone still talks about
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
To hold each other tight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
To keep it in your mind and not forget
You are there in the flickering light
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
He built a fire on Main Street
I think that it's best
I'm moving after midnight
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Without any doubt
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
It don't take too long to find out
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
That might be all that you got
You used to laugh about
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
You don't forget
And, since my feet are now fast
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
You're hearing my heart beat
But, then again, there's only one I've met
There's some people that
She seems too far out
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Talking that the heat put
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
The slow one now will later be fast
I soon get some rest
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
One more night I will wait for the light
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
How many years can some people exist
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
One more night the moon is shining bright
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
And the first one now will later be last
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
The slowest now will later be fast
Plants in the bed, but
But, if the arrow is straight
We can hold up a toast if we meet
They tell me to be discreet
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
He really wasn't where it's at
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Everything is always right
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Well, I finally started thinking straight
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
I got into the driver's seat
Every new messenger bringing evil report
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Keep it in your mind and not forget
They tell me revenge is sweet
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
You're gonna get hit
Wait for the morning light
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Johnny's in the basement
I'm on the pavement
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
So he never thinks straight
To protect you and defend you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And I tell this truth to you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I can be just like you
To be alone with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I just might have to come see you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Yes, I'd sure like to know
I'd sure like to know
Down every street there's a window
Ring them bells for the chosen few
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Don't it always a-go to show
The only one I know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Don't it always go to show
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
He been living there three years now
Well, I'd sure like to know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Sooner or later one of us must know
It only goes to show
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
But sooner or later one of us must know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
With only you in view
But I can't deny
For them that must obey authority
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Though I'd never say
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Don't you tell Henry
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Maggie says that many say
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
No, you'll not now or no other day
She smiles, walks the other way
From phony jealousy
And it's up to you to say
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
For them that think death––death's honesty
For them that think death's honesty
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
So they took him to the infirmary
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
That I done it the way
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
That I was just a puppet in a play
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
And I'm leaving every day to run away
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Or if you just want some company
My ears hear a symphony
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
The Spanish-American War had its day
I did not do it harmfully
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
So, I'm walking down your highway
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Spouted out that liberty
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
But you can never steal away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
The same thing I would want today
My mind weaves a symphony
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Is worth more than I could pay
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And that which you've given me today
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
And the only tune my guitar could play
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
To those condemned to act accordingly
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Someone to get you flowers constantly
She starts to speak, but he walks away
A cock is crowing far away
But I wish there was something you would do or say
We banged the drum slowly
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
How many times must the cannon balls fly
And for His love they took His life away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
I send you all my money
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Went to the doctor the very next day
She puts it to me plain as day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
So I run down most hurriedly
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Well, I'm walking down the highway
If I don't take the chance to try
She knocked upon it anyway
And the ladies treat me kindly
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Hava–na–
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Disconnect these cables––
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Remember me to one who lives there –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
I'm sure it was not three –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
That can win what's a-never been won –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Havanagee–luh–
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Hang out the whole next day –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
I a-hope you can hear––
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Whispering your secret emotion –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
With no other choice except but for to go –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Indians camp along her border –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
You will not hear a laugh –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Turn, turn, turn again –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
How badly they were shocked –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
I long to hold you in the night –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
I got no idea what I want –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I hope that you can hear––
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
To know where you are –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
First degree and second degree –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Havana–gee–
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Ha–va–
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
It can't be this way everywhere –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Private reasons – great or small –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
With notions his canoe was laden –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Ten thousand miles or more –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Leave all the children home –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Oh, my–
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
