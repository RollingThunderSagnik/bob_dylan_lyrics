She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Yes, come out your window!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Dance!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Country'll grow."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
And pretend that you never have met."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
I would want again tomorrow."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
So write to her tenderly."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
I didn't see you around."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
I'll bring back my lady."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
We want folksingers here."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
I can't find my knees."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And says, "Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"That way down Highway 61."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
God said, "On Highway 61."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Tangled up in blue."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
And keep him good company."
He said, "Tell me about it."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
I'll apply them all to thee."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Come flowing down so free?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
You and I'll never know."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
You can't blame us at all."
They look as white as snow."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
I love far better than thee."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Will mourn for your return."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Have it on Highway 61."
You can't blame me at all."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Where you and I will unite."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
We'll both go off together."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You must know about my debutante."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
And hung on a willow tree."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
But we were tangled up in blue."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Has kindly assisted me home."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
They look as dark as night."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
And it's all for the love of thee."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
It's all for the love of thee."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
That you must always first forgive them."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
And punched my cigarette."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
But I know what you want."
I'll endow them onto thee."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
And have it on Highway 61."
Get on your horse and ride away."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
We'll both go home together."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I'll see her soon, I know."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Heart of mine,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
To be––direction home,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
She would have married me,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
I'd already gone the distance,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Don't ever try to change me,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Precious angel under the sun,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
And forget my pride,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Well, well, well,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Well, I'm so glad,
Watching the river flow,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
In one the surface was frozen,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
When the night comes falling,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
"Come along and take a trip,
Fare thee well but for a while,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
A dream about you, baby,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
To a solid rock,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
I thank the Lord,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Carved next to his name,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
It always means so much,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
I'd only have to stay,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I can change, I swear,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Circled by the circus sands,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
You have given everything to me,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
You got something better,
The Second World War came to an end,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Is used, it is plain,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Stand up straight and tall,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Tell me that you love me only,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Each time we meet, love,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
The country doctor rambles,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
That foreign sound in your ear,
God knows it's true,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Get dressed, get blessed,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Resent him to the bone,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
I'd be sad and blue,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
How does it feel,
So, never leave me lonely,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Simplify you, classify you,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Come on, come on, stick together,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
You'll change your last name, too,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
But he can't be blamed,
True love, they've been without it,
Pressing on,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
They say every man must fall,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
You were striped, you were plain,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
You gotta look some other place,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
By losers, cheaters,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Don't let her know that you love her,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Well, get sick, get well,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
They don't believe in mercy,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Staying far behind without you,
With his candle lit into the sun,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Love that's pure no accident,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
God knows there's a purpose,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Give you my money, honey,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
You to me were true,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
But evidently she don't,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Till both of us fell by the way,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
And you make love just like a woman,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Don't let me drift too far,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
I'm pledging my time to you,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Tell me,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
He's young and on fire,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
The day you quit me, baby,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
God knows you ain't pretty,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
May be an actor in a plot,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
It's like I ain't here,
You can run down to the desert,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Where I will always be renewed,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
I can't understand,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
People carry roses,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
My hands didn't touch him none,
To gather flowers constantly,
Ye shall be changed,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Three by three, it don't set on me,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
And the whole world is on your case,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
To hang and to lynch,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
My limbs are shaking,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
But the bottles are done,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
She leave by the other and roam,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Grandpa died last week,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Whether you are right or wrong,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Over the hills and far away,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Five by five they tried to survive,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Broken idols, broken heads,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Love don't have any place,
New morning,
He been around the world and back again,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
A thousand miles from home,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
The night would see me wide awake,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
They lowered him down as a king,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Precious memories, how they linger,
For she ain't the same,
If you'd see me this a-way,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
That the laws are with him,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Someone to close his heart,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Like some mystery,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Winter would have no spring,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Every moon is so sanctified,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
China doll, alcohol,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Get born, keep warm,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
If you must cling to someone,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
I never can go because, you know,
When you think that you've lost everything,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
It's too bad he had to go,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Need a woman all the time,
More people kept a-piling on,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Equality, liberty,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
The light I never knowed,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
God knows there's a chance,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Just then the order came to charge,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
I run right home and I went to bed,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Going home,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Get back, write Braille,
And every cause that ever I fought,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I ain't looking to block you up,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
My woman needs it every day,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
She said she would never forget,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
You married young just like your ma,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Every brain is civilized,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Looking for a new fool,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
But you were gambling for support,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Well, come all without, come all within,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
And, if I can save you any time,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
It's really something,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
I like the way that you move your hips,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Someone to open each and every door,
Better jump down a manhole,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
And on the highway of regret,
People going down to the ground,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
I would not feel so all alone,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
It could even be like a myth,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Searching high, searching low,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Just don't know what to do,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
I been good while I been waiting,
He got that soft, silky skin,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
And give him back the time he's done,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
The winter would hold no spring,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
The path you've endured has been rough,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
You can raise up your right hand,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
May be living in another country under another name,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
To shine in through,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
As the daylight hours do increase,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I don't want to meet your kin,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Out to the windy beach,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Like a dog on a chain,
And I––I walk out on my own,
And, if I see the day,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
It was a girl I learned it from,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
In love and with kindness,
Go down to the river, babe,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
In the instant that I preach,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Go melt back in the night,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
That two healers cannot heal him,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
You have given all there is to give,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Far past the frozen leaves,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
I threw it all away,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Of this I can't say very much,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
In the turning of twilight,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Laying low,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
I've been all around the world, boys,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I went into the city, into the town,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Read books, repeat quotations,
Yesterday is just a memory,
My love, she speaks softly,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
All I really wanna do,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Under the microscope,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
I wish tonight were here,
Precious father, loving mother,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Something about you that I can't shake,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
They say everything can be replaced,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
A hand set the spark,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
To protect his white skin,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
And she'll be coming forth,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
She never does me wrong,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Don't try No Doz,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Get jailed, jump bail,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
And pretend that we never have touched,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
There's always someone who understands,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
I had no one for to go my bail,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Wasn't making any great connection,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
People talk over situations,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Hold me, baby, be near,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
I got no place left to turn,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Corrina, Corrina,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Ever since I been a child,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
You have explained every mystery,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
I just keep pressing on,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
All them prophets good and gone,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
A true love of mine,
The beat is pumping,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Eh, see what you can do,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
The country music station plays soft,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Watch the plain-clothes,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I been riding the midnight train,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
He won't do nothing to you,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
I long to see you in the morning light,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
So unknown,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
The wind blowing the snow around,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
I rambled out of New York town,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Look away, you rolling river,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
They must bust in early May,
Like you never did before,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
If ever I prove false to you,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
But you're doing it again,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
We'll fly the night away,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Day you quit me, baby,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Don't let yourself stumble,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
You're beautiful to me,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
In his anger and his shame,
Heart of mine, go back home,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
See her in that very tight skirt,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
See you fly or watch you die,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Don't tie no bows,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Couldn't even see the floor,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
I try my best to be just like I am,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
With the juice running down my leg,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Since you've been gone,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Going, going,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
They took a clean-cut kid,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
You have given me life to live,
Where life and death are memorized,
But, if I can save you any time,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Madams light the candles,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
To hide 'neath a hood,
I just don't see why I should even care,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
But I'm saved,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Don't steal, don't lift,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
You always responded when I needed your help,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Like as not, it's better so,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
If anything is gonna sell,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Yes, and I'll go last,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
The joint is jumping,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Mixing up the medicine,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Don't let her see where you're going,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
You don't want a love that's pure,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
I won't have my nature way,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
I try my best to be like I am,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
And to come every time you call,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
In the hills of mystery,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Ain't no going back,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I just say no thanks,
"Not I," said the referee,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Badge out, laid off,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
In the ruins of your balcony,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Look who's back in town,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
The carpet too is moving under you,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
I'm leaving today,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
To be on your own,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
It's alright,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
And to come each time you call,
I once held her in my arms,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
To be alone with you,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Oxford Town around the bend,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
If'n you don't know by now,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
You don't have to feed me,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
To have––be on your own,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
A man named Martin Luther King,
You made it there somehow,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You can hear them tires squeal,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Name of Martin Luther King,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
How he died nobody can say,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Father of black, father of white,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Want you so bad,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Stone you when you are young and able,
But I've been hanging on,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Yet every distance is not near,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
I just don't know what to do,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
But, if you ride back and I am left,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
For her to arrive,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Come all without, come all within,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Without a love of my own,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Advertising signs, they con,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
And may you stay forever young,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Tears on the letter that I write,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Go away from my window,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
When she lays upon the grass,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
With his fist in a clinch,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Don't let her see,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Stay away from the train line,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
To be without a home,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
You stole her love from me one day,
But it would not be new,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Human gods aim for their mark,
The day would surely have to break,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Bring the wife and family,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Private reasons, great or small,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Aim well, my little one,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
And I'm in the shade,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Going, going, gone,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Drifting too far from shore,
I'm so glad,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
You got something I want plenty of,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Says he's got a bad bill,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Thieving in the alley,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
I got the worried blues,
You have given me eyes to see,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Giving back all of what you owe,
That her father was going to hang,
Father of cold and father of heat,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
And ride a horse along the trail,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
You want watered-down love,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
It's rising up above my head,
Far away from it all,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
I went back home, put on my tie,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
The one we can see and can feel,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
And I got the worried blues,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Makes no difference where she's been,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
My existence led by confusion boats,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
God knows it's a crime,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Don't wear sandals,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Well, there ain't no going back,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
So I got those worries blues,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
A million faces at my feet,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Without a dream in my heart,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
God don't call it wrong,
That you'd have liked me to,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
One summer's day he came passing by,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
This world is ruled by violence,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Never needed to call you my whore,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Puffing on a big cigar,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
People talk of situations,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
I went down where the vultures feed,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
As I travel down life's pathway,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
But I'm pressing on,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Stone you just like they said they would,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Forever young, forever young,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
She said she would always stay,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Each one playing a horn,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
So glad,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
When there is no more,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
All you can do is do what you must,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
That fellow who never blushes,
Up and down the block,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
If you throw it all away,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
And I don't want to drag you down,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
She's crying like an evil stone,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Thinking about the government,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Dream about you, baby,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
God knows how to make it flow,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Don't let yourself fall,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
The man in the trench-coat,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Well, I been gambling so long,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Without ideals or violence,
I can make it through,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
God knows when,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
You better chew gum,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
With no direction home,
Watch the river flow,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Nothing too very scientific,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
You had enough of hatred,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
I'm going back to Colorado,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Just remember that death is not the end,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Loneliness, tenderness,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Look out, kid,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
They say every man must need protection,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
And there's two white horses following me,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Hang around the ink-well,
A foreign sound to your ear,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
All the silver, all the gold,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
I got two white horses following me,
Far away in the stormy night,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Like a complete unknown,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
By users, cheaters,
My arms and legs were broken,
Strangers all give me the news,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Oh, see what you can do,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
A change in the weather is always extreme,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
And here I sit so patiently,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Hazel, you called and I came,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
I'm going out of my mind,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
As his youth now unfolds,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
That can do what's never been done,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
But he's the property of Jesus,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
And it's only that I'm asking,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
I got a wife and five little children,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Ooh, watered-down love,
But it ain't me, babe,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
God knows there's a river,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Is looking for a new fool,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
God knows that, when you see it,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
We take great delight in our own company,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Friends with you,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And I'm so glad,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
A complete unknown,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
It was you who came right through,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Who could they get to carry you,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
The kingdoms of experience,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Icicles hanging down,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Father of day, father of night,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
But ye shall be a-changed,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Going,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
From their fates try to resign,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
By rivers of blindness,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
They say every man needs protection,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Over your senses you have no control,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
It don't matter what you did,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Every head is so dignified,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
The air is getting hotter,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
God knows there's a heaven,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Carry the New York Times,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Nothing was delivered,
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Of ancient history,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
That must be what it's all about,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
God knows everything,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Far away and over the wall,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Or have done something wrong,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
And furnish me with tape,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
She got great big hind legs,
Make you spin or do you in,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
They––they show me to the door,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Got me a secret membership card,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
And not going through any great extreme,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Don't let me change my heart,
Father of air and father of trees,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
He's the property of Jesus,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
He is centuries old,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Don't let her hear,
God knows it's terrifying,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
The only son of God Almighty,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Vanished from my hand,
I had so much left to do,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
While riding on a train going west,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
If not for you,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Had a dream about you, baby,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
For all intended purposes,
At the close of the day,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I shall be released,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Oh, Angelina,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
"Not me," said his manager,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
One by one they followed the sun,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
In the end,
I march in the parade of liberty,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Everything's a-hers or his,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
There she come, now, down my way,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
To keep up his hate,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
And she makes love just like a woman,
And also by his feet,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
To strict party-platform ties,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
For his age he is wise,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
And your streets are getting empty,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Hanging 'round the theaters,
I should have left this town this morning,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
To know how much I really care,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
As the present now will later be past,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
For the wise men and the fools,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
You better duck down the alleyway,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I bless the day I found you,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
I can't be good, baby,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
God knows you've got to weep,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Waiting for the trains,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
The sky too is folding under you,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
I can see the turning of the key,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
On the stone that remains,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
But, deep inside my heart,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Yes, I want you so bad,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
I think we better talk this over,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
And it ain't me, babe,
We'll go someplace unknown,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
You could look at it and weep,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Searching everywhere I know,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
And, though the line is cut,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
I've been saved – well, alright,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Can't find what I need,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I landed up on the downtown side,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
The sky too is folding over you,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
If your time to you is worth saving,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
In the great unknown,
In the lonely night,
When I was in Missouri,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
I tried to reach you, honey,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Don't put yourself over the line,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
But I know that he don't talk,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
In another I witnessed a crime,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Analyze you, categorize you,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
And it's like I ain't here,
While paupers change possessions,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
And think they're fooling you,
You've got to serve somebody,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
It always has hit me from below,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
If you can't quit your sinning,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
God sees it all unfold,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Stone you and say good luck,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
And it still ain't me, babe,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
But, it ain't me, babe,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
If I didn't have to guess,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
A question in your nerves is lit,
If you'd see me this way,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
We've killed each one,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Baby, please stop crying,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
It still ain't me, babe,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
And I'm back in the rain,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
It was from her ship sailing,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
A man with a badge skips by,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
One by one until there were none,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
I got a bird that whistles,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
You even make love just like a woman,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
It's not aimed at anyone,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
For something that he never done,
I got those worried blues,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Said I'm pressing on,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Don't let her know,
But you try with your whole soul,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Broken hands on broken plows,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I've been around this whole country,
Don't wanna be a bum,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Two by two they step in the dark,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Better jump down the manhole,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
I need a shot of love,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Tell her not to worry,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Now, lamp-gates and <i>[incomprehensible]</i>, I can recite 'em all,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
You will be alright, girl,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
I had a dream about you, baby,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
They say that every man must fall,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
I'll go see them come down my way,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
This situation can only get rougher,
Light yourself a candle,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
And you take just like a woman,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
I can finish this alone, honey,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Relationships of ownership,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
They say every distance is not near,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
For the politician's gain,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Want you,
Looking 'bout the government,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Keep me where you are,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
God knows it's outta sight,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
How he died nobody could say,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Without your sweet love,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
God knows it's a struggle,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
When I seen him lose control,
They say every man need protection,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Using every angle under the sun,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Stripping away at it all,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
God knows it's fragile,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Gonna serve somebody,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
But the time ain't tall,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
In the darkness of my night,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Memory, ecstasy,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Is it really any wonder,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
And come every time you call,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
When all will be well,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Trouble,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Keep a clean nose,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
I don't care if you feel like me,
With what your fate is going to be,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
You need something to open up a new door,
And, if anybody asks me,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Had no one to go my bail,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Who will promise never to part,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Automobile coming into style,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Why she did go,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Like a rolling stone,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
No, nothing was delivered,
Heart of mine, be still,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Went back home to the yard,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Serve somebody,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
You and me, we had completeness,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I got my mind made up,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
She once was a true love of mine,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
My dear, sweet friend,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
My senses have been stripped,
If she ain't feeling well,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Don't matter what you did,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
On this new morning, new morning,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
I've been in and out of happiness,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Or select you or dissect you,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Joey, Joey,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Not the end, not the end,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
But it ain't him to blame,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
I'll be on my way,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
And comes to a permanent stop,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Face full of black soot,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
One by one they follow the sun,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Trust yourself,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I'm going down the river,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
It's a price I have to pay,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
And the point is slick,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Hmm, I can make it through,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
To be so useless and all,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
To find out if she's talked,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Where mercy walks the plank,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
And I'm just like that bird,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
With a killer's pride, security,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Eh, singing just for you,
But something has changed,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
You need something to open your eyes,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
But, if I will save you the time,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
That they do not respect in any degree,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Silvio, I gotta go,
She'll be coming forth,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Thank You, Lord,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
In the shadows of moonlight,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Father of night, father of day,
Well, I may just swear,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
And, although that we're single and free,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
And point away from the past,
Got my mind made up,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
One more night the stars are in sight,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I been good,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
I have no one to meet,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Just like I did before,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
May you stay forever young,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
But now morning is clear,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
And joined the John Birch Society,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
They keep it all hid,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
He's not selling any alibis,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
You can stick your head in the sand,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Oh, watered-down love,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
To stay closer than any friend,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Made before the foundation of the world,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Don't follow leaders,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Never did feel this way before,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Never weak, but always strong,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
I want my arms around you,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
I want you,
Loyalty, unity,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Front door shut, back door too,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Well, I'm pressing on,
She'll surely turn to white,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
First degree and second degree,
Too serious to fool,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
May be the head of some big TV network,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
You were snow, you were rain,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Says he's got a bad cough,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Oh, singing just for you,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Seven days,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Socialism, hypnotism,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Just to know that you are near,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
God don't call it treason,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
They tell me every man must fall,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Don't you tell Henry,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
And gathering storms may arise,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Try to be a success,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
That fired the gun,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Three angels up above the street,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Mercury, gravity,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Made of silver or of golden,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
I want you so bad,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Just like a rolling stone,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
And you know I could never be your own,
Six months on the chain gang,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Speaking to some French girl,
True love of mine,
It hurts me, too,
We live in a political world,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Watered-down love,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
I know I can't win,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
I get my sweet reward,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Saved,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
She's opened up a happy home,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
But, to remain as friends,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Went to the station down in the yard,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Wintertime in New York town,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
And she aches just like a woman,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
You wanna drown love,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
But, if you want me to,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
I can't cross the line, you know,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
I'm never, never far from home,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
To be out on your own,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
And played the fife lowly,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Too noble to neglect,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
And I got those worried blues,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
To your tambourine in time,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
You got to serve somebody,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
The night passed away so quickly,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Try hard, get barred,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
That's where you belong --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Democracy don't rule the world --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Friends with you.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
I can't fight them anymore.
Blood on your saddle.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
And I was brought up by my brother.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
Life don't mean a thing.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I'll hold it down for you.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
To know which way the wind blows.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And the night blows rainy.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
With gold and silver in her hand.
If I ride back again.
And each one I've never seen again.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
But my heart just won't give in.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Look a-the other way.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Everything is gonna be fine.
And time is beginning to crawl.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
I just can't beg you anymore.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
I been in this thing too long.
And she had left him to die in there.
You left me standing out in the cold.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
The country doctor rambles.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.

And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
Step lightly on the ground.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders. I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
They say that you're planning to put me down.

Ain't no loving since she been gone.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.

I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.

One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.

Up and down the lonesome town.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
And it never seemed strange.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.

Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
It was you who understood.

"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.

All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
I threw it all away.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
To the old folks' home and the college.
But he sure left here in style.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Tomorrow will be another day.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Got my mind made up.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
The whole night through.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Find out something only dead men know.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
Watch the parking meters.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
It don't matter anyhow.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Remember me to one who lives there.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
If'n you don't know by now.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Drink up your blood like wine.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Tell me.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
'Cause I don't think about it.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
To anything I mighta tried.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
Bid farewell forever.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
My face you'll never see no more.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Carry for you deep down inside.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Tangled up in blue.
Hope that it don't sleet.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
But I know that I can't move.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
That Johanna's not here.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
And ye shall be changed.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
I needed somebody to talk to.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
I see that stationmaster too.
I got nothing left to burn.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Oh, got my mind made up.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
But these to tell what's true.
Down along my restless palms.
To live it you had to explode.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
A-lord, protect my child.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Crumble into one another.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
I know you always say that you agree.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Bring that bottle over here.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
So long, honey babe.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Oh, her darling love she found.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
While I'm in the hall.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
When I paint my masterpiece.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Need that woman straight and true.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
My mind is breaking.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
I'll remember you.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Baby, baby...
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Humility, simplicity.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
I think this time we should escape.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
She once was a true love of mine.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
And disregards the rest.
Because everybody must get stoned.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
A man named Martin Luther King...
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
And no time to think.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Headed out for the western skies.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Just what this song is all about.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
And without further notice he asks you how it feels.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
Honey, I never would have come.
Yes, tell me.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Precious memories flood my soul.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
But you're never sure why you're here.
And all your raging glory.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
And one day he came passing by.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
That number eleven was closing.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
That's the way I remember her best.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
For me to return to or chase.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
I can't hear you anymore.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Never been so easy or so slow.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
See that my grave is kept clean.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
When I'm alone with you.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
And your golden loom.
And ye shall be a-changed.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
But I would never do you wrong.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
You'd better get that in your head.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
And try to avoid the scandals.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
The same as my father before him.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
And she'll only know he's dead.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
Foundationed deep somehow.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
I didn't realize how young you were.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
I took some comfort there.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
There was nobody around.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Rode slowly back again.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
But she had some way of finding them out.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Crying out that he was framed.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
And I want you to be that woman.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
What's real and what is not.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
To the sin of love's false security.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Please let me ride you home.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
In the pale moonlight.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
I only saw what they let me see.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.

Unthought of, though, somehow.
Where I was born and partly raised.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Turned on my record player.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Epitome, rigidity.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
But all I see are dark eyes.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Close your eyes, close the door.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
And then unto eternity.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
For an instant hand touched hand.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
As if a wedding vow.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
She's in some foreign land.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Just you and me.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Remember, before you come, at least please first telephone.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Lay dead beside him there.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Must be and that is all.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
For that's the way I remember her best.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Into my own parade.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
That just struck me kinda funny.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
You have no idea what you do to me.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Baby, two feet from the well.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
I finally got a job in New York town.
The sooner you can go.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Adiós, mi corazón.
I've seen trouble all my days.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
It always does when you're with me.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
I seen a man.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Hmm, tell me.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
It hurts me, too.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I'd like to know.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
So the radio didn't work so well.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
I had so little time to fail.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
I want you.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
You don't have to be afraid.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
On the caboose of the train.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Rain would gather, too.
That big, old boat started to sink.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
There's no words that need to be said.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Living down Sonora way.
The words that her lover had said.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And make promises by the hours.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Everything inside is made of stone.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I just go pump on it some.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Mine alone.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
I'd give anything to be with you.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
You're a big girl now.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
But that's what I am paid to do.
In the brightness of my day.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Unless they're from another world.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Drifting too far from shore.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Thought I was a communist.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
And discovered her invisible self.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
At not getting their money's worth.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
His epitaph plain:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Yeah, serve somebody:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
But there's one promise, darling:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Serve somebody:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Till I come into New York town:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Crumble into one another;
All lies and jest;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
Some speak of the future;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Make promises by the hour;
About everybody that was hanging out;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
I find complete love;
Had to be held down by big police;
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [Incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
Just what in the world has come over you?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Of everything you see?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
How long are we gonna be riding?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Does anyone even try?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
So I can know if I'm really real?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
How many more without any reward?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
What can I give to You?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
How can I live for You?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Too many people have died?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
How many paths did they try and fail?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Are you the same person that was here before?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Like a rolling stone?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
And one deserving of affection?
What else can a poor boy do?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
How could they let you go?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Just like a rolling stone?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Have they missed you?
To love and follow His direction?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
That too many people have died?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Baby, can't you tell?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Where did you lose your wings?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Has anybody seen my love?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Where did you hide your halo?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Can I come home with you?
Am I ready?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
But who did I see but the one I love?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
How does it feel?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Before you call him a man?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
When he's standing in front of you?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Are you ready?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
What can I do for You?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
How can you say he will haunt you?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
How could they ever mistake you?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Across the swooping plain?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Before they're forever banned?
How many compared to yesterday?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Am I still dreaming yet?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Gal, where you been so long?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
How much poison did they inhale?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Across the swamp of time?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Oh, so why not you and me?
By golly, what more can I say?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Can you get back in?
Before he can hear people cry?
How many more can they afford?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Does he change the course of rivers?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Why would I want to take your life?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
What would life be?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
When did you leave heaven?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Baby, can I come home with you?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
And how does it feel?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Before he can see the sky?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Why and what's the reason for?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
For all these earthly things?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Baby, what more can I tell?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Why must you always try to make me over?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Must everybody bow?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Who killed Davey Moore?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
What good am I?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
How's everything in heaven?
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
You have to pay to get outta
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
It was put together down in Argentina
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Somebody seen him hanging around
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
I had to say something to strike him very weird
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Many times I've often prayed
It's something you did
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Now you don't act so––so proud
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
All the sweethearts you can hold
Now, a very great man once said
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I run right home and I went to bed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
And that even the nobles get properly handled
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now you don't seem so proud
And into the path you are hurled
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
So I'll make my stand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Then came the warning that was before the flood
And those whom doom and death had spared
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
And things would be different the next time we wed
You used to be so amused
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
But now something has changed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
We live in a political world
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Its iron claws attached
You used––be so proud
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Now, whenever I get up and
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I'll always thank the Lord
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
I live in another world
Just what you had in mind
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
But she ain't gonna find the road
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
To see him obviously framed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
She let go of my hand
I've been walking around
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Nothing was delivered
There ain't nothing in this world
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And then you told me later as I apologized
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
The changes I was going through can't even be used
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Maybe someday you will understand
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
They took a clean-cut kid
I will not go down under the ground
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
How many times can a man turn his head
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Silvio, silver and gold
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
But all that suffering was not to be compared
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
He was a clean-cut kid
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
"Equality". I spoke the word
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
As I stand upon the sand
By no special friend
I thought that it was well-understood
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
I want you, baby, just to understand
While some, on principles baptized
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Things would be different the next time we wed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
I still can remember the way that you smiled
And your trouble is you know it too good
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
For what you sold that's not been received
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
If dogs run free, why not we
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
It's all new to me
You know, it's not even safe no more
On the rising curve
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Full of hope and desire
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
See the primitive wallflower freeze
A bed that is never mine
It's getting dark, too dark to see
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
She knows there's no success like failure
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
"It's only you that he does crave
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
If dogs run free, then what must be
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
You could almost think that you're seeing double
She plunged him into well water where
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
If dogs run free, why not me
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
The crashing waves roll over me
We see this empty cage now corrode
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
What good am I then to others and me
And plenty time for good romance
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
You cut to the core
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
What's probably got you baffled more
They say don't come back no more
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Should I put them by your gate
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Remember me to the one who lives there
But I feel nothing for their game
That she's the same one
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Better stay away from those
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Up into some paradise
A girl who would murder her own, true love
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
So I look like a walking mountain range
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Waiting to find out what price
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
You into thinking you're the one
Leaving men wholly, totally free
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Why wait any longer for the one you love
How was I to know you'd be the one
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
"That I might be gone a long, old time
What about that millionaire
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Just what you will say when you get home
But the dark does die
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
So I remember every face
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
At dawn my lover comes to me
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Maybe someday you will look back and see
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Says it's closing time
All I feel is heat and flame
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Mona tried to tell me
Should I leave them by your gate
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
But I can get another one
You just pick anyone
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Most of the time I can't even be sure
While them that defend what they cannot see
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
You said you'd never compromise
Con you into thinking that you're the one
From the start by the rule
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
She been gone
And never sat once at the head of the table
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Just pick anyone
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
How many ears must one man have
It'll be with me unto the grave
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Among the lovely people living free
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
There were times when I was so lonesome
And you see why it's so unique to be
To give the special one you seek a chance
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
You're not free to belong to me
Hunger pays a heavy price
I do declare
Little did I realize
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
And I would send a message
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Limited in sex they dare
Knows there's no success like failure
I don't even notice she gone
The man the authorities came to blame
From all the plans they do pursue
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
I rode with him in a taxi once
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
When Reilly's daughter got a message
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
I been wondering all about me
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
I can survive and I can endure
Breaking hearts up and down the line
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And the Negro's name
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And suddenly there appeared before me
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Looking at hands for the lines that were
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Everybody's wearing a disguise
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
I am homeless, come and take me
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
As he rises to fame
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
To show you something you seen before
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Remember me to one who lives there
And I ain't complaining none
When the rain is blowing in your face
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
When the roses fade
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
"Oh, father, you will surely die
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Lies that life is black-and-white
But I can't say I sympathize
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
When I'm all alone
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
He'll see by his grave
So, I called up the operator of time
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
So up she picked her babies three
Taking care of somebody nice
Though its shadow's metal badge
You say you're looking for someone
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Feel to moan, but unlike before
The cause was there before we came
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
But then a whistle will be blowing
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
The battle outside raging
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
She rode by night and came by morning
For your weary toes to be touching
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
If I was with her too long
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
The order is a-rapidly fading
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
What am I saying? What am I knowing
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
You left me standing in the doorway crying
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
It's not a bad way to make a living
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
The order is rapidly fading
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
They're drinking up and walking
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Where the time and the tempo drag
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Deceived me into thinking
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
'Cause the battle outside raging
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And there's no telling who that it's naming
There's nothing in here moving
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
You go north and you go south
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And how I know I'll make it through
I have fallen far beneath
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Then she told us how times were tough
Look out, the saints are coming through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Her voice once and talk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Well, there ain't no going back
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
You turn around to take a final peek
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
I wish she'd unlock
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
But they caught him and they brought him back
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Make everything from toy guns that spark
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
The man in me will do nearly any task
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Shoot in the back
How many seas must a white dove sail
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
How does it feel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Then why don't she tell
All and all can only fall
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
And if my love is real
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Muttering small talk at the wall
A-how does it feel
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Well, if I die on top of the hill
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Oh, how does it feel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
He's sure got a lot of gall
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
They ask me how I feel
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
But among the dead that were left on the hill
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
I chased me a woman up the hill
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
A girl by the whirlpool
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Ring bar, hard to tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
How many seas must the white dove sail
He's taught in his school
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And remain as I am
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
"For you cannot relive them
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
But I can hear another drum
You better not chew gum
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Two eyes took the aim
As you sit on the box you keep him in
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And the corner sign
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Advertising signs that con
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Have died in battle or in vain
For the loser now might be later to win
But the post office has been stolen
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Guns and clubs followed him down
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
You take just like a woman
Well, you fake just like a woman
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Yet I swear I see my reflection
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
All their daughters put me down
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
But all their daughters put me down
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
"Not me," said the gambling man
How can the life of such a man
To remember the times when I was your only man
I'll be waiting at the station
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Must meet the dawn
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Suicide remarks are torn
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
And there's no exit in any direction
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
My love, she's like some raven
And all their daughters put me down
But the second mom was with the seventh son
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
I figure maybe we're even
To my knowledge there's just one man
And you ache a-just like a woman
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
But I swear I see my reflection
Darkness at the break of noon
From heights that they could not gain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
How many roads must a man walk down
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And she aches just like a woman
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Will not be understood as they're spoken
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Somebody new to beat on
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
But it's hard to think on
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
But me, I expected it to happen
As they rode him in custody down to the station
In the pigpen
The ones that jump on the wagon
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
The foreign sun, it squints upon
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
She takes just like a woman
The next morning she had awoken
He got that fortress on the mountain
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
And she wakes just like a woman
Yes, and someone must explain
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
For the loser now will be later to win
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
You don't need a weatherman
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
She said that all the railroad men
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
She got such a sweet disposition
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
You need something to make it known
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
But the second mother was with the seventh son
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Their religion of the little ten women
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
That long, black train is pulling on down
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Why did you trade heaven
Well, I'm hanging on
A-she takes just like a woman
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Trying to get a lead on
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Out of the shower comes a football man
That long, black train is pulling down
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
There's nothing you can say or do
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Every place I wanna go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Silvio, I gotta go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
All I really wanna do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
All I'd like you to do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
I walked down there and ended up
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Man in the coon-skin cap
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
What good am I while you softly weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Aladdin and his lamp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
The man in the coon-skin cap
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
How many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
You heard me saying a prayer for
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Still I've always kind of missed her
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
The face of God will appear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Who came here from Cuba's door
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
At any moment you could go under
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
And I don't even think about her
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
The wind howls like a hammer
I don't have to go far
The lover who has just walked out your door
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Alone you stand with nobody near
Still I say her love-words over
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Never no more do I wonder
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
All you boys better run for cover
When you whispered in my ear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
So, don't fear if you hear
When only you are near
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
But morning is clear
In one I was running and in another
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
I close my eyes and I wonder
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
For I am married to a house carpenter
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I say, "Why you say that for
For all eternity I think I will remember
She took him by his long, yellow hair
I could feel a whole lot better
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
You been hurt so many times
Now, you must provide some answers
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
"Not me," said the man whose fists
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And, though the masters make the rules
You should be made to wear earphones
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
People carry roses
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
I try to tell it like it is
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And inside it with the people made of molasses
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
To sharpen the senses
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
With a fantastic collection of stamps
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
At times I think there are no words
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Good and bad, I define these terms
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
With a big bouquet of the roses
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Thinking of a series of dreams
Mama, you know, awaits the news
What good am I if I say foolish things
To the cutting of fences
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Don't follow leaders
Six-time losers
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
But still remains
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
When your mother sends back all your invitations
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
As friends and other strangers
And tells me of her dreams
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
You can fall down on your knees
And your father, to your sister he explains
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
He's not selling any alibis
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Seven days
And so Patty calls the cops
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
You never turned around to see the frowns
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
I was thinking of a series of dreams
True love can make a blade of grass
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
We living in times when men commit crimes
And then complains
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Wants eleven dollar bills
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Statues made of matchsticks
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Don't wear sandals
But, though the masters make the rules
They whisper in the wings
I'm gonna let you pass
Six-time users
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
And the poor white remains
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Romantic facts of musketeers
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
To memorizing politics
You know that he has no intentions
Glide across the lonely years
People on the platforms
I'd gladly confess
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And I try to harmonize with songs
The cowboy angel rides
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
That it's you and no one else that owns
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Girl by the whirlpool's
Well, the ragman draws circles
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Her window's wide open, African trees
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And the princess and the prince discuss
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Yet you know there is no answer fit
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
You used to laugh–make fun about
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
So he never thinks straight
Oh, everybody's got to eat
In the precious winds they rot
You used to laugh about
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
He built a fire on Main Street
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
And, since my feet are now fast
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Well, I finally started thinking straight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
By the way, that's a cute hat
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
And I, in my armor, turning about
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Our Father would not like the way that you act
How many years can some people exist
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
She seems too far out
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
How many years can a mountain exist
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
It don't take too long to find out
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
You're hearing my heart beat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
You're gonna get hit
They tell me revenge is sweet
Everything is always right
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
In the stillness of the midnight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
You don't forget
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
You are there in the flickering light
Without any doubt
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
Plants in the bed, but
To hold each other tight
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
I got into the driver's seat
One more night I will wait for the light
I soon get some rest
One more night the moon is shining bright
That might be all that you got
With your pockets well protected at last
Wait for the morning light
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
They tell me to be discreet
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Well, early in the morning till late at night
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
To keep it in your mind and not forget
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
He really wasn't where it's at
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
The slowest now will later be fast
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
There's some people that
Johnny's in the basement
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Talking that the heat put
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Everyone still talks about
I think that it's best
The slow one now will later be fast
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
But, if the arrow is straight
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And the first one now will later be last
Keep me set apart
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Ain't it hard when you discover that
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I'm on the pavement
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
And I tell this truth to you
I'll remember you
It's just crazy being here with you
To be alone with you
I can be just like you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I just might have to come see you
To protect you and defend you
He been living there three years now
But sooner or later one of us must know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Sooner or later one of us must know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
The only one I know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Don't it always a-go to show
Well, I'd sure like to know
I'd sure like to know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Don't it always go to show
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
With only you in view
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
It only goes to show
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
My mind weaves a symphony
So, I'm walking down your highway
Though I'd never say
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
And that which you've given me today
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
But I can't deny
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
She puts it to me plain as day
We banged the drum slowly
Or if you just want some company
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
From phony jealousy
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
She smiles, walks the other way
And the only tune my guitar could play
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
The same thing I would want today
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
To those condemned to act accordingly
And for His love they took His life away
For them that think death's honesty
For them that think death––death's honesty
Don't you tell Henry
And it's up to you to say
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
That I done it the way
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
The Spanish-American War had its day
That I was just a puppet in a play
No, you'll not now or no other day
But I wish there was something you would do or say
I did not do it harmfully
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
If I don't take the chance to try
She starts to speak, but he walks away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
A cock is crowing far away
For them that must obey authority
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
And the ladies treat me kindly
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
How many times must the cannon balls fly
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
She knocked upon it anyway
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
My ears hear a symphony
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
I send you all my money
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Spouted out that liberty
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
So I run down most hurriedly
So they took him to the infirmary
Maggie says that many say
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Is worth more than I could pay
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Went to the doctor the very next day
But you can never steal away
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Disconnect these cables––
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Seven more years I longed to have her –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Ha–va–
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Indians camp along her border –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
As suicide remarks are torn –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Remember me to one who lives there –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Havanagee–luh–
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
How badly they were shocked –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I a-hope you can hear––
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Whispering your secret emotion –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
To know where you are –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Oh, my–
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
It can't be this way everywhere –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
I hope that you can hear––
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
I'm sure it was not three –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
It's just a ragged clown behind –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
First degree and second degree –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
You will not hear a laugh –
Hang out the whole next day –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I long to hold you in the night –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Hava–na–
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
Leave all the children home –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Havana–gee–
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
I got no idea what I want –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Private reasons – great or small –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
With no other choice except but for to go –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
