You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Oh, yeah!

Alright!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!

They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
He punched me out!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
I ain't different than anyone!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
They was all over!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
It was the mailman!
Oh, no!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!

She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Alright, now!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Betty Ross!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
So long, New York!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Looking for my lo and behold!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Goodnight!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
I've got the freight train blues!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Thank you!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I'm in love with you!
Yeah, man!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Play that guitar now!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Lordy, Lord!
Oh!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
They got away!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Them Reds did it!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Hope I don't find out too much!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
I got the freight train blues!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
She's insane!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
My God, they killed Him!
Start over!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
How they ever flood my soul!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Well!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Dance!
You must think I'm crazy!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Good God!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Woo-hoo!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Woo!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Yes, come out your window!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Howdy, East Orange!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Yippee!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Hootenanny television!
Take me down to California, baby!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And punched my cigarette."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Tangled up in blue."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I'll endow them onto thee."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Have it on Highway 61."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
I didn't see you around."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
We'll both go off together."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
I'll bring back my lady."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Come flowing down so free?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
They look as dark as night."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
So write to her tenderly."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
Where you and I will unite."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
We'll both go home together."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Country'll grow."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
I can't find my knees."
"Have you seen dignity?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
For that reason I will have to stay."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
And keep him good company."
You can't blame me at all."
I'll see her soon, I know."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
That you must always first forgive them."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
And says, "Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
I would want again tomorrow."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
And hung on a willow tree."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
And it's all for the love of thee."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
You and I'll never know."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Would kill a little bird like me."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"That way down Highway 61."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
But I know what you want."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I love far better than thee."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
We want folksingers here."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
I'll apply them all to thee."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
He said, "Tell me about it."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
God said, "On Highway 61."
Has kindly assisted me home."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
You must know about my debutante."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
They look as white as snow."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
And pretend that you never have met."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Get on your horse and ride away."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
It's all for the love of thee."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
And have it on Highway 61."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Will mourn for your return."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
You can't blame us at all."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
But you try with your whole soul,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Pressing on,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
He's the property of Jesus,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
For the wise men and the fools,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
The day you quit me, baby,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Oh, in somebody's room,
I had so much left to do,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
I'd be sad and blue,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
In the instant that I preach,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Into my own parade,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
But the time ain't tall,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
But evidently she don't,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
In another I witnessed a crime,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I got two white horses following me,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
I'll be on my way,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
This situation can only get rougher,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
And to come each time you call,
Mercury, gravity,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Light yourself a candle,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
They say every distance is not near,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
He won't do nothing to you,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
That you'd have liked me to,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
The kingdoms of experience,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Baby, please stop crying,
I can't cross the line, you know,
So many roads, so much at stake,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Wasn't making any great connection,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
To find out if she's talked,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
You got to serve somebody,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
And I got those worried blues,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
With the juice running down my leg,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
With no direction home,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
But I would not feel so all alone,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
I just keep pressing on,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
In the ruins of your balcony,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
You better duck down the alleyway,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
A foreign sound to your ear,
And comes to a permanent stop,
And furnish me with tape,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Stay away from the train line,
Most of the time it's well understood,
In the turning of twilight,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Yes, I want you so bad,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
To be without a home,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Where I will always be renewed,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Get born, keep warm,
By rivers of blindness,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Try to be a success,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Why she did go,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
It don't matter what you did,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
I went down to scrub and rub,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
But it ain't him to blame,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
I have no one to meet,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
And not going through any great extreme,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Keep me where you are,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
You've got to serve somebody,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Better jump down a manhole,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
China doll, alcohol,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
I just can't beg you anymore,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
If ever I prove false to you,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Hold me, baby, be near,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Just then the order came to charge,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
In the darkness of my night,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Hmm, see what you can do,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
When she lays upon the grass,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I've been in and out of happiness,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
And she makes love just like a woman,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
For his age he is wise,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Already the fiesta has begun,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Look who's back in town,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
All the tired horses in the sun,
You'll change your last name, too,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
I'm never, never far from home,
Every brain is civilized,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Out to the windy beach,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
They don't believe in mercy,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Just don't know what to do,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Don't let me change my heart,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
One by one until there were none,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Serve somebody,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Strike another match, go start anew,
He's not selling any alibis,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
And I got the worried blues,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
It all seemed so well-timed,
But, to remain as friends,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I would not feel so all alone,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
For she ain't the same,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
God knows you've got to weep,
Want you so bad,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Going, going, gone,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Tell me,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Where the neon madmen climb,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Read books, repeat quotations,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
And forget my pride,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I'm going out of my mind,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
They keep it all hid,
Watching the river flow,
I want you,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
If anything is gonna sell,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
I been riding the midnight train,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
A thousand miles from home,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
More people kept a-piling on,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Said I'm pressing on,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Laying low,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
A dream about you, baby,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
The night would see me wide awake,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
How does it feel,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Father of loneliness and pain,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Well, well, well,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
You have given all there is to give,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
And she aches just like a woman,
Don't tie no bows,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
You could look at it and weep,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
To gather flowers constantly,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
I bless the day I found you,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I want my arms around you,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Where mercy walks the plank,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Try hard, get barred,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Madams light the candles,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
If you throw it all away,
She'll surely turn to white,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
That fellow who never blushes,
Waiting for the trains,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
The country music station plays soft,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
It always has hit me from below,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Without ideals or violence,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
You have given me life to live,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
You made it there somehow,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Just to know that you are near,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Better jump down the manhole,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
But you were gambling for support,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
God knows there's a heaven,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
They lowered him down as a king,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Beating for the dead that rise,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
And, if I can save you any time,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
May be living in another country under another name,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
We live in a political world,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
It's rising up above my head,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
God knows there's a chance,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
In love and with kindness,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
God knows that, when you see it,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
And I'm back in the rain,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
I got those worried blues,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
So, never leave me lonely,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
The wind blowing the snow around,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
To be on your own,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
I'm going down the river,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
They say every man must need protection,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
If I didn't have to guess,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Father of cold and father of heat,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Strangers all give me the news,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Went back home to the yard,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
It's alright,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
That the laws are with him,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Socialism, hypnotism,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Oh, Angelina,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
I threw it all away,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
True love, they've been without it,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Oh, singing just for you,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Alright, I'm so glad,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Winter would have no spring,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Or have done something wrong,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
And I'm in the shade,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Precious father, loving mother,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Every head is so dignified,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Is used, it is plain,
You can run down to the desert,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Precious angel under the sun,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Looking for a new fool,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Give what I got until I got no more,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Honey, I will meet you there,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
On this new morning, new morning,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
My love, she speaks softly,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Couldn't even see the floor,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Mixing up the medicine,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
And I'm just like that bird,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
You and me, we had completeness,
Don't let yourself fall,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
The sky too is folding under you,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
He got that soft, silky skin,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Got me a secret membership card,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Front door shut, back door too,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Or select you or dissect you,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
A million faces at my feet,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Stripping away at it all,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
And played the fife lowly,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
In the little church a-this side of town,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
A complete unknown,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
I went out last night to take a little round,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
I get my sweet reward,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Just like a rolling stone,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
When all will be well,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Stone you and say good luck,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
That can do what's never been done,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Analyze you, categorize you,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
That foreign sound in your ear,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Heart of mine, be still,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
And on the highway of regret,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
I been good while I been waiting,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
One by one they followed the sun,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
I wish tonight were here,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Going,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
And the point is slick,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
But I'm saved,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Aim well, my little one,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
In the end,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
So I got those worries blues,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
But I've been hanging on,
Of this I can't say very much,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Corrina, Corrina,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Trouble,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
All you can do is do what you must,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
With what your fate is going to be,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
The angels play on their horns all day,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
God knows it's true,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Heart of mine,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
You wanna drown love,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Father of air and father of trees,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
She never does me wrong,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
You stole her love from me one day,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Broken hands on broken plows,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Eh, see what you can do,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
And you take just like a woman,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Had no one to go my bail,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
This world is ruled by violence,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Heart of mine, go back home,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
You always responded when I needed your help,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
The man in the trench-coat,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
To stay closer than any friend,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Well, I'm pressing on,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Now you don't talk so loud,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
We'll fly the night away,
They took a clean-cut kid,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
It's too bad he had to go,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Of ancient history,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
I just say no thanks,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
You gotta look some other place,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
You find God in the church of your choice,
You can hear them tires squeal,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Tell me, tell me before I go,
I can't be good, baby,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
My dear, sweet friend,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
You had enough of hatred,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
It's really something,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
At the close of the day,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Is it really any wonder,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Look away, you rolling river,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
The joint is jumping,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Give you my money, honey,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
In a pine box for all eternity,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
They tell me every man must fall,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Don't you tell Henry,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
But, if I can save you any time,
It was from her ship sailing,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
And it ain't me, babe,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Well, I'm so glad,
As human gods aim for their mark,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Going, going,
That fired the gun,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Resent him to the bone,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
That two healers cannot heal him,
But, deep inside my heart,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
But I know that he don't talk,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Now, lamp-gates and <i>[incomprehensible]</i>, I can recite 'em all,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
The Communists was a-coming around,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
The day would surely have to break,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Broken idols, broken heads,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Too serious to fool,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Someone to open each and every door,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
And, if anybody asks me,
That must be what it's all about,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
My senses have been stripped,
I don't wanna fake you out,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Where life and death are memorized,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
As his youth now unfolds,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
She said she would never forget,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
It's a price I have to pay,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
You got something I want plenty of,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
They––they show me to the door,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
He been around the world and back again,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Wintertime in New York town,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
To be so useless and all,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
"Not I," said the referee,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Cares not to come up any higher,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
My existence led by confusion boats,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
I can make it through,
She would have married me,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Went to the station down in the yard,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Like you never did before,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
In the great unknown,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I'm leaving today,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Friends with you,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
You want watered-down love,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Relationships of ownership,
I try my best to be like I am,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
They say everything can be replaced,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
And ride a horse along the trail,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Go melt back in the night,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
You were snow, you were rain,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
I got the worried blues,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Circled by the circus sands,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Each one playing a horn,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
To know how much I really care,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
From their fates try to resign,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
But the bottles are done,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
But, it ain't me, babe,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
He's young and on fire,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Made of silver or of golden,
You have given everything to me,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
One by one they follow the sun,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Thank You, Lord,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Don't let her know,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
And give him back the time he's done,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Carved next to his name,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
And think they're fooling you,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
You broke a heart that loved you,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Bring the wife and family,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Got my mind made up,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
A man named Martin Luther King,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
The winter would hold no spring,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
People talk of situations,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
People talk over situations,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Simplify you, classify you,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
As the daylight hours do increase,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Tell her not to worry,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Ever since I been a child,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Six months on the chain gang,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Human gods aim for their mark,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
To be––direction home,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Face full of black soot,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
I just don't see why I should even care,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Well, get sick, get well,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Father of night, father of day,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
And point away from the past,
Who will promise never to part,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
I want you so bad,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
And, though the line is cut,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
You have explained every mystery,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
I like the way that you move your hips,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Yet every distance is not near,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
I don't care if you feel like me,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Love that's pure no accident,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
And it still ain't me, babe,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
There's always someone who understands,
Holding his club like he was a king,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
I went back home, put on my tie,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
God knows everything,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
To a solid rock,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Ain't no going back,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
If'n you don't know by now,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
And your streets are getting empty,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Broken lines, broken strings,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
I've been around this whole country,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
"Not me," said his manager,
I'll go see them come down my way,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
You better chew gum,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
If not for you,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Tears on the letter that I write,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
A true love of mine,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
She's opened up a happy home,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
They say every man must fall,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Searching high, searching low,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Speaking to some French girl,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
God don't call it wrong,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
A hand set the spark,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
They say that every man must fall,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
But something has changed,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
To be alone with you,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
And, although that we're single and free,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
That they do not respect in any degree,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
With his fist in a clinch,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
All I really wanna do,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Thieving in the alley,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
All the silver, all the gold,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
But you're doing it again,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Winterlude by the road tonight,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Far away in the stormy night,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Ah, get sick, get well,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
You need something to open your eyes,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
When you think that you've lost everything,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
All them prophets good and gone,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
God knows it's fragile,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
You were striped, you were plain,
I like the cool way you look at me,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
She's crying like an evil stone,
But he can't be blamed,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Searching everywhere I know,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
I'm so glad,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Don't ever try to change me,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Three by three they're turning the key,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Well, I been gambling so long,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
They say every man needs protection,
And you know I could never be your own,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
I shall be released,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
To shine in through,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Look out, kid,
Saved,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
If you'd see me this way,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Spent my money on you, honey,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
They say every man need protection,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
I got my mind made up,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Love don't have any place,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Three angels up above the street,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
The light I never knowed,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Far away from it all,
To keep up his hate,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Don't follow leaders,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
By users, cheaters,
Like some mystery,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Make you spin or do you in,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
My limbs are shaking,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
But it ain't me, babe,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Not the end, not the end,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Made before the foundation of the world,
That five walls cannot hide him,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Don't let yourself stumble,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Forever young, forever young,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Without a dream in my heart,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
You to me were true,
God sees it all unfold,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Tell me that you love me only,
Need a woman all the time,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
God knows it's outta sight,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Eh, singing just for you,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
For her to arrive,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
God knows you ain't pretty,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Don't wanna be a bum,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Using every angle under the sun,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Is looking for a new fool,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
We take great delight in our own company,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Hmm, I can make it through,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
On the stone that remains,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
My woman needs it every day,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Seem like I been down this way before,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
And, if I see the day,
Thinking about the government,
And I'm so glad,
Five by five they tried to survive,
He is centuries old,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
And ye shall be a-changed,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
How he died nobody can say,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
God don't call it treason,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Dream about you, baby,
Oxford Town around the bend,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
It was you who came right through,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
You married young just like your ma,
As the present now will later be past,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Drifting too far from shore,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
And you make love just like a woman,
The carpet too is moving under you,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
You got something better,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
To strict party-platform ties,
The country doctor rambles,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
And the whole world is on your case,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Don't let her hear,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
And pretend that we never have touched,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
At ships with tattooed sails,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
I never can go because, you know,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Badge out, laid off,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
It's not aimed at anyone,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
The only son of God Almighty,
Going home,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Ye shall be a-changed,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
No, nothing was delivered,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
But it would not be new,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
When I seen him lose control,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Staying far behind without you,
God knows how to make it flow,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
You will be alright, girl,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
And there's two white horses following me,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Go away from my window,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
And it's like I ain't here,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
To hang and to lynch,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
To your tambourine in time,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Trust yourself,
Every moon is so sanctified,
The one we can see and can feel,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
To be out on your own,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Don't matter what you did,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
See you fly or watch you die,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Like a dog on a chain,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
My arms and legs were broken,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Loyalty, unity,
Advertising signs, they con,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
She said she would always stay,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Stone you just like they said they would,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
In the shadows of moonlight,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Each time we meet, love,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
I should have left this town this morning,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Over your senses you have no control,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Oh, watered-down love,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Don't let her see,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Who could they get to carry you,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Well, the way I love that woman,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
But he's the property of Jesus,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Like as not, it's better so,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
I just don't know what to do,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Don't try No Doz,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Never needed to call you my whore,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
A handle hid out in the dark,
I'm going back to Colorado,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
We've killed each one,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
God knows when,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
The sky too is folding over you,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I think we better talk this over,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
In his anger and his shame,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
And she'll be coming forth,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
The man there said he loved my sound,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Nothing too very scientific,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Never weak, but always strong,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Over the hills and far away,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
So glad,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Go down to the river, babe,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
If she ain't feeling well,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
To protect his white skin,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Memory, ecstasy,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
With a killer's pride, security,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Want you,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Ten thousand men on the move,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Come all without, come all within,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
When the night comes falling,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Up and down the block,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
But, if you want me to,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
I'm gonna let you pass,
God knows it's a struggle,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
While riding on a train going west,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Don't put yourself over the line,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
When there is no more,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Somewhere down the road some day,
It's like I ain't here,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
I got a wife and five little children,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Under the microscope,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Watered-down love,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
And to come every time you call,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Like a rolling stone,
I'd already gone the distance,
When I was in Missouri,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Can't find what I need,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Joey, Joey,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
I can change, I swear,
But now morning is clear,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
It could even be like a myth,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And here I sit so patiently,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
The air is getting hotter,
Without your sweet love,
And gathering storms may arise,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
To have––be on your own,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
And also by his feet,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Nothing was delivered,
May be an actor in a plot,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
For all intended purposes,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
God knows there's a river,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
She'll be coming forth,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Puffing on a big cigar,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
It hurts me, too,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Stone you when you are young and able,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
You're beautiful to me,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
You can stick your head in the sand,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Don't mind the driving rain,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
By losers, cheaters,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
That her father was going to hang,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Someone to close his heart,
I don't want to meet your kin,
You need something to open up a new door,
Never did feel this way before,
Vanished from my hand,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
But, if I will save you the time,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
You don't have to feed me,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Watch the plain-clothes,
I got no place left to turn,
God knows there's a purpose,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
The train leaves at half past ten,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
How he died nobody could say,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Looking 'bout the government,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
My love, she speaks like silence,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Adiós, mi corazón,
May you stay forever young,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Father of black, father of white,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I'd only have to stay,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Well, I may just swear,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Too noble to neglect,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Well, I gave you all my money,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
You'll be doing society a favor,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
We never much thought we could get very old,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Keep a clean nose,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
There she come, now, down my way,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
The path you've endured has been rough,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
While paupers change possessions,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
I need a shot of love,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Carry the New York Times,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
God knows it's terrifying,
For something that he never done,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
I landed up on the downtown side,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
But I'm pressing on,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
That four ears cannot hear him,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Grandpa died last week,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Far away and over the wall,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
First degree and second degree,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
She leave by the other and roam,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
She got great big hind legs,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
We'll go someplace unknown,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Stand up straight and tall,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Watch the river flow,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Since you've been gone,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
I got a bird that whistles,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
"Come along and take a trip,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
You can raise up your right hand,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Newspapermen eating candy,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Gonna serve somebody,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
In one the surface was frozen,
Seven days,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
And the sooner you come up with them,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
You have given me eyes to see,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
In the hills of mystery,
If you must cling to someone,
It always means so much,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
I had no one for to go my bail,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
I won't have my nature way,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
People carry roses,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Without a love of my own,
You even make love just like a woman,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I rambled out of New York town,
Private reasons, great or small,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
The Second World War came to an end,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
I thank the Lord,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Like a complete unknown,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
And may you stay forever young,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
New morning,
The night passed away so quickly,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
I know I can't win,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Don't wear sandals,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Hang around the ink-well,
And come every time you call,
Get back, write Braille,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
God knows it's a crime,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Day you quit me, baby,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
You're beautiful beyond words,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Well, there ain't no going back,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Don't let me drift too far,
Oh, see what you can do,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Well, come all without, come all within,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
So unknown,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Equality, liberty,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
The beat is pumping,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
It still ain't me, babe,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
I once held her in my arms,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Father of day, father of night,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
I can see the turning of the key,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Automobile coming into style,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
But ye shall be a-changed,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
I swung on to my old guitar,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
In the lonely night,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
May be the head of some big TV network,
People going down to the ground,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,

I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
Go lightly on the ground.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
You don't have to worry any more.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
68, but says she's 24.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
You always got more than enough rope.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
In my Cadillac.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
And the pearls are from Japan.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
For the times, they are a-changing.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
The place that I started from.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Adiós, mi corazón.
And keep away from pranks.
So long, honey babe.
Mary wore three links of chain.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
And shot it fulla holes.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
And you must realize the danger.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
In the night the price was paid.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
It'll never do, somehow.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.

Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.

When they didn't wanna know or see.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
You only got ten.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
And discovered her invisible self.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Oh, got my mind made up.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
Remember me to one who lives there.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
And I'll go last.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
You're a big girl all the way.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Honey, I never would have come.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
He never did know what it was all about.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
What some people are gonna do for money.
New morning.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
To know which way the wind blows.
To which a scoundrel clings.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Can't see over to the other side.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Throw my ticket out the window.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
By that soft and shining sea.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
I shall be released.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
She once was a true love of mine.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
I can walk anytime around the block.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Is gonna be against the law.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
Lord, protect my child.
Someone's watching over you.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
You don't have to be afraid.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Well, I'm just thumping.
You can say I didn't give to you.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Never will want for money.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
Step lightly on the ground.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Hmm, tell me.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
And it is time for me to slide.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Going, going, gone.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Unless they're from another world.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend – no, I never seen him before.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
You have no idea what you do to me.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Come on, baby.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Mama, you are on my mind.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot".
And I need you, yeah.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
And all your raging glory.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Hope that it don't sleet.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
That big, old boat started to sink.
In the dark land of the sun.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
'Steada acting like we never met.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Patriotism, materialism.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
All because of the color of his skin.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Oh, Angelina.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
But you break just like a little girl.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
But simply because it's true.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
You're a big girl now.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
You want a watered-down love.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Drink up your blood like wine.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
My love, she speaks softly.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
I'm younger than that now.
Using ideas as my maps.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Looking for a new friend.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
I'm not the one you need.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Orders from the D.A.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
He's got his mother's eyes.
I just can't beg you anymore.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
With gold and silver in her hand.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
68, but says he's 24.
Yes, tell me.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
But my heart just won't give in.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
To see that you're madly in love.
Have fallen from her curls.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
I don't know.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
I only saw what they let me see.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Even the softest touch.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Never been so easy or so slow.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
That linger in the fireball heat.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
That last night I was with.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
And without further notice he asks you how it feels.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Honey, come and see about me.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
To live it you had to explode.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Under the hedges.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Billy, you been running for so long.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Who always was too proud to beg.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
It was you who understood.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Feel further away than ever before.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
Go find out something only dead men know.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Everything is gonna be fine.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Tried to create a next world war.
Of every man who put me here.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
That's the day you die.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
On the caboose of the train.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
We may not make it through the night.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
That number eleven was closing.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
While the law looks the other way.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
She's in some foreign land.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Under the midnight moon.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
When you made everybody pay.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Baby, two feet from the well.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
And guarded them as they fell.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
With an iron chain around his neck.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
To the sin of love's false security.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
I didn't realize how young you were.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Everybody's having them dreams.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
If you won't come out your window.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
Hope I don't blow it.
It ain't quite the end.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Oh, convey herself away.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
I couldn't find any.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
While I'm in the hall.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
That old ship was a-going down.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Fighting every inch of the way.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Now and forever let it be me.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
I'm falling in love with you.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
And disregards the rest.
Some speak of the future.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Sweet lady.
Just to take somebody's money away.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
His voice was low with pain.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
By the jealousy of others around her.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Bid farewell forever.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
With the glory that is to be.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
He ain't-a got no name.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Walking around with no one else.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
You can make it too.
In the palace of the Pope.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
Evidently she won't.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Behind a man's brain.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
She just acts like we never have met.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Neighborhood bully.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
And gives it to me for a song.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
They would not let me be.
Everything is broken.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Greenwich Village.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
And they gotta cut something.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
To anything I might have tried.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
And rivers that ran through every day.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
What you'll say when you get home.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
He gone north for a while.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
And there's no time to think.
See him at play makes me smile.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Your voice was all that I heard.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
And all I see are dark eyes.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
At not getting their money's worth.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Just remember that death is not the end.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
Rode slowly back again.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Trust yourself.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
"Don't trill no news on me.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Fear to bring children into the world.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
And get something quick to eat.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
I think this time we should escape.
I see that stationmaster too.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
The night will soon be gone.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Trying to create a next world war.
It's just the old American way.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a, a bone.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Just crying out that he was framed.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
And each one I've never seen again.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Epitome, rigidity.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Remember, before you come, at least please first telephone.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
A foreign sound to your ear.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Crying out that he was framed.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Gonna serve somebody.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
If you just let me follow you down.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
That I really did try to get close to you.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
The country doctor rambles.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
There's no words that need to be said.
I got trouble in my mind.
And it never seemed strange.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
I will only let you down.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Chain you down or bring you down.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
I don't even know why we come.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
The sooner you can go.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I got a bird that sings.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
It can't be this way everywhere.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Up and down the lonesome town.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
You're on the bottom.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
And I was brought up by my brother.
I just can't keep from crying.
I never saw the man again.
We all know for sure that it's real.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
I took some comfort there.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Blood on your saddle.
I just can't do what I done before.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Kisses she gave him three.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
The last radio is playing.
It don't matter anyhow.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Than people who are most content.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
Madams light the candles.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
You are on the bottom.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
And your golden loom.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
Buildings going up to the sky.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
And tapestry of rhyme.
I see better days and I do better things.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
I just can't see through it anymore.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
From my toes up to my ears.
Must be and that is all.
You got it, baby.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Is when I'm alone with you.
And I want you to be that woman.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Duality, mortality.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
He went down to Oxford Town.
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
And come away with me.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Where I was born and partly raised.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
She saw her father's body broken.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
She acts like we never met.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
You cast your spell and I went under.
We were the wrong side.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
Or stay all night with thee.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Or define you or confine you.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
The same as my father before him.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Lay dead beside him there.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Ever since we've been apart.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
She pretends like we never have met.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
I did not do it knowingly.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
A true love of mine.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
And say you'll always let it be me.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
In the summertime when you were with me.
And the night blows rainy.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Just like so many times before.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
But I can't get close to her at all.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
And left me here facing the wall.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
I can't fire them anymore.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
Until my dying-day.
Tangled up in blue.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
After losing every battle.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
When you go your way and I go mine.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
She murdered mortal he.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
He's the neighborhood bully.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
It sure is right on a night like this.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
Until I threw it all away.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
Find out something only dead men know.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
But with the country to where you're going.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
See like me or be like me.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
When my memory is not so short.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
And then unto eternity.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
I want you.
All because his face was brown.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
It hurts me, too.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.

Heart of mine.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.

With guns in their hands and God on their side.
You to me were the best.
Baby, please come home.

As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
And laid his life on the line.

I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
People bending broken rules.
Funny way to start a picnic.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Hope you're ready.
Rain would gather too.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
While my conscience explodes.
Suffering like a fool.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
And you only got ten.
In the pale moonlight.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Drifting too far from shore.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
I don't care what in the world you do.
With all these promises you left for me.
Who says she knows me well.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
It's just the same as talking to you.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Wasn't any difference to me.
For me to return to or chase.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
On this new morning with you.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
I had so little time to fail.
To be alone with you.
I'd like to know.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
My mind is breaking.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
The hour when the ship comes in.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
But I know that I can't move.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
Everybody must get stoned.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
I'll be your baby tonight.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
You know, I loved her just the same.
His enemies say he's on their land.
But the fighter still remains.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Saying wants company.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
She can't find him anywhere.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Hear me singing through these tears.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
You know the song in my heart.
Some place so high above this wall.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Most of the time.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
It's that million dollar bash.
Someone to open each and every door.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
It always does when you're with me.
Chain you down or be your clown.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
By the saving grace that's over me.
I can't fight them anymore.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
And I've never been too impressed.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
If you throw it all away.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
I can't see through it anymore.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Crying out that he been framed.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
He's always on trial for just being born.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
His mama sure was proud of him.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
So quickly into autumn.
People sleeping in broken beds.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
It don't matter, anyhow.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Just what he was talking about.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
Where teardrops fall.
I once held her in my arms.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Turned on my record player.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Is just equality in school.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Ever since I seen you there.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
But you're back where you belong.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Girls like birds fly away.
And then go on home and have my fun.
And he was a friend of mine.
I'd be lost if not for you.
I just go pump on it some.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
You'll do as much for me.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Mine alone.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
I know you always say that you agree.
But she had some way of finding them out.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
I froze right to the bone.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Everything is gonna be alright.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
Going back where we come from.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Leading me, going home.
Rain would gather, too.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
I needed somebody to talk to.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Till I come into New York town:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
His epitaph plain:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
But there's one promise, darling:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Man is opposed to fair play:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Serve somebody:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Crumble into one another;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Some speak of the future;
I find complete love;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Had to be held down by big police;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
All lies and jest;
Make promises by the hour;
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
Everybody that was hanging out;
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [Incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>

<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
So I can know if I'm really real?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
How much poison did they inhale?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
What can I do for You?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
For all these earthly things?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Like a rolling stone?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
And how does it feel?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
How's everything in heaven?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
How could they let you go?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Before you call him a man?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Am I ready?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Must everybody bow?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Can I come home with you?
Too many people have died?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
What else can a poor boy do?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Are you the same person that was here before?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Oh, where are you tonight?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Has anybody seen my love?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Who's gonna let it roll?
What would life be?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
By golly, what more can I say?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Why and what's the reason for?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
To love and follow His direction?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Before he can hear people cry?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Can you get back in?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
That too many people have died?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Before they're forever banned?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have they missed you?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Of everything you see?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Is it rolling, Bob?
How many more can they afford?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Does anyone even try?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
How does it feel?
Baby, what more can I tell?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Before he can see the sky?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
And one deserving of affection?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Across the swamp of time?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
When he's standing in front of you?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
What good am I?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
What can I give to You?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Where did you lose your wings?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Where did you hide your halo?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
When did you leave heaven?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How could they ever mistake you?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Baby, can't you tell?
How many more without any reward?
How many compared to yesterday?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
How can I live for You?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Gal, where you been so long?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Why would I want to take your life?
Are you ready?
Across the swooping plain?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Just like a rolling stone?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
The love that a stranger might receive?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
There ain't nothing in this world
Nothing was delivered
I thought that it was well-understood
He was a clean-cut kid
Maybe someday you will understand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And those whom doom and death had spared
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Now you don't seem so proud
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
But all that suffering was not to be compared
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
But now something has changed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Then came the warning that was before the flood
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
I will not go down under the ground
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
I live in another world
Many times I've often prayed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
You used––be so proud
I'll always thank the Lord
For what you sold that's not been received
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Just what you had in mind
They took a clean-cut kid
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
I want you, baby, just to understand
How many times can a man turn his head
And things would be different the next time we wed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
It's something you did
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And into the path you are hurled
Its iron claws attached
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Now, whenever I get up and
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
I run right home and I went to bed
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
While some, on principles baptized
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
To see him obviously framed
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
By no special friend
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
"Equality". I spoke the word
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And then you told me later as I apologized
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I had to say something to strike him very weird
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
So I'll make my stand
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
All the sweethearts you can hold
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Now you don't act so––so proud
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
We live in a political world
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Now, a very great man once said
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Silvio, silver and gold
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Somebody seen him hanging around
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Things would be different the next time we wed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
You used to be so amused
Standing on the water, casting your bread
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
The changes I was going through can't even be used
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
She let go of my hand
And your trouble is you know it too good
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
I've been walking around
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
But she ain't gonna find the road
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
As I stand upon the sand
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Everything stays down where it's wounded
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
When I'm all alone
To give the special one you seek a chance
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Knows there's no success like failure
He'll see by his grave
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
The cause was there before we came
What about that millionaire
You say you're looking for someone
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
The crashing waves roll over me
At dawn my lover comes to me
And I would send a message
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Better stay away from those
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
"That I might be gone a long, old time
But it won't be over till they clear his name
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Limited in sex they dare
Maybe someday you will look back and see
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
If dogs run free, why not me
Looking at hands for the lines that were
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
But the dark does die
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
You cut to the core
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
And the Negro's name
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I been wondering all about me
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Where I could watch her waltz for free
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
You into thinking you're the one
Full of hope and desire
And I'm just the same as anyone else
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
A bed that is never mine
I'm ready for to fade
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
It's all new to me
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
But I can't say I sympathize
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
"Oh, father, you will surely die
And her silver-studded phantom cause
With all memory and fate
While them that defend what they cannot see
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
"It's only you that he does crave
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
When the roses fade
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Just what you will say when you get home
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
That she's the same one
You're not free to belong to me
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
So up she picked her babies three
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And never sat once at the head of the table
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Lies that life is black-and-white
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
I'm sure you're the one to blame
The man the authorities came to blame
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
You said you'd never compromise
Mona tried to tell me
Among the lovely people living free
But I can get another one
As he rises to fame
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
You could almost think that you're seeing double
She plunged him into well water where
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
They say don't come back no more
If dogs run free, why not we
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
What good am I then to others and me
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
From the start by the rule
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
But I feel nothing for their game
You just pick anyone
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
So I remember every face
What's probably got you baffled more
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
From all the plans they do pursue
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Up into some paradise
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Should I leave them by your gate
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Taking care of somebody nice
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Why wait any longer for the one you love
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And plenty time for good romance
All I feel is heat and flame
How was I to know you'd be the one
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Feel to moan, but unlike before
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
I do declare
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
She been gone
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Well, six white horses that you did promise
And you see why it's so unique to be
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
You know, it's not even safe no more
See the primitive wallflower freeze
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Remember me to one who lives there
It's getting dark, too dark to see
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Little did I realize
She knows there's no success like failure
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Waiting to find out what price
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Hunger pays a heavy price
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Remember me to the one who lives there
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
When the rain is blowing in your face
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Most of the time I can't even be sure
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Though its shadow's metal badge
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
There were times when I was so lonesome
Leaving men wholly, totally free
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
And that is that one must always flush out his house
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
If dogs run free, then what must be
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
And I ain't complaining none
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
And suddenly there appeared before me
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
I don't even notice she gone
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
How many ears must one man have
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
To show you something you seen before
Everybody's wearing a disguise
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Just pick anyone
So I look like a walking mountain range
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
I can survive and I can endure
So, I called up the operator of time
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
On the rising curve
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
It'll be with me unto the grave
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Should I put them by your gate
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
I am homeless, come and take me
I rode with him in a taxi once
Says it's closing time
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Trust yourself
Oh, trust yourself
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
She rode by night and came by morning
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
If I was with her too long
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Deceived me into thinking
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
And there's no telling who that it's naming
The order is rapidly fading
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Where the time and the tempo drag
The order is a-rapidly fading
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
There's nothing in here moving
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
You left me standing in the doorway crying
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
But then a whistle will be blowing
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Early in the morning, early in the morning
What am I saying? What am I knowing
The battle outside raging
It's not a bad way to make a living
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
For your weary toes to be touching
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
They're drinking up and walking
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
'Cause the battle outside raging
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Look out, the saints are coming through
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And how I know I'll make it through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I have fallen far beneath
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Then she told us how times were tough
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You turn around to take a final peek
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Her voice once and talk
Shoot in the back
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
The man in me will do nearly any task
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Well, there ain't no going back
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
I wish she'd unlock
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
How does it feel
Oh, how does it feel
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Muttering small talk at the wall
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Ring bell, hard to tell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
He's taught in his school
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
To make all that should be killed to crawl
They ask me how I feel
A girl by the whirlpool
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
A-how does it feel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Then why don't she tell
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
How many seas must the white dove sail
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
All and all can only fall
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
As the last fire-truck from hell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
I chased me a woman up the hill
And if my love is real
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
He's sure got a lot of gall
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Ring bar, hard to tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
How many seas must a white dove sail
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
But I can hear another drum
Two eyes took the aim
And remain as I am
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
"For you cannot relive them
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
So, one morning when the sun was warm
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You better not chew gum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Out of the shower comes a football man
That long, black train is pulling on down
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
She said that all the railroad men
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
In the pigpen
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
To remember the times when I was your only man
You need something to make it known
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Suicide remarks are torn
Advertising signs that con
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Somebody new to beat on
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
As you sit on the box you keep him in
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I figure maybe we're even
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And there's no exit in any direction
To my knowledge there's just one man
There was little to say, there was no conversation
But me, I expected it to happen
Will not be understood as they're spoken
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
And she wakes just like a woman
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
"Not me," said the gambling man
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
All their daughters put me down
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Must meet the dawn
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
How many roads must a man walk down
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
A-she takes just like a woman
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
And she aches just like a woman
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
You don't need a weatherman
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
But I swear I see my reflection
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
The next morning she had awoken
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
She takes just like a woman
For the loser now will be later to win
But it's hard to think on
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
But the post office has been stolen
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
From heights that they could not gain
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
She got such a sweet disposition
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Well, I'm hanging on
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Guns and clubs followed him down
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Please don't let on that you knew me when
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
The foreign sun, it squints upon
But the second mother was with the seventh son
But all their daughters put me down
For the loser now might be later to win
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
You take just like a woman
I'll be waiting at the station
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
How can the life of such a man
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
The ones that jump on the wagon
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
He got that fortress on the mountain
Well, you fake just like a woman
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Their religion of the little ten women
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
My love, she's like some raven
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
And the corner sign
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Darkness at the break of noon
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Yes, and someone must explain
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Why did you trade heaven
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And you ache a-just like a woman
And all their daughters put me down
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
That long, black train is pulling down
Trying to get a lead on
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Have died in battle or in vain
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
There's nothing you can say or do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Every place I wanna go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
All I'd like you to do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
All I really wanna do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Silvio, I gotta go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
How many times must a man look up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Man in the coon-skin cap
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Aladdin and his lamp
What good am I while you softly weep
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
The man in the coon-skin cap
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
The face of God will appear
I say, "Why you say that for
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
For all eternity I think I will remember
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
So, don't fear if you hear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
In one I was running and in another
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
And I don't even think about her
The wind howls like a hammer
At any moment you could go under
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
When you whispered in my ear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Still I say her love-words over
Never no more do I wonder
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
I don't have to go far
Who came here from Cuba's door
She took him by his long, yellow hair
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
When only you are near
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
For I am married to a house carpenter
Alone you stand with nobody near
All you boys better run for cover
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Still I've always kind of missed her
You heard me saying a prayer for
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I could feel a whole lot better
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
I close my eyes and I wonder
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
The lover who has just walked out your door
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
But morning is clear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
On the back of the fish truck that loads
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And, though the masters make the rules
Six-time users
With a big bouquet of the roses
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I'd gladly confess
You should be made to wear earphones
Don't wear sandals
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
They whisper in the wings
To sharpen the senses
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
What good am I if I say foolish things
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
To the cutting of fences
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
As friends and other strangers
And I try to harmonize with songs
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Her window's wide open, African trees
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Romantic facts of musketeers
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Don't follow leaders
How many deaths will it take till he knows
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Good and bad, I define these terms
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
True love can make a blade of grass
I'm gonna let you pass
People carry roses
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
You never turned around to see the frowns
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Girl by the whirlpool's
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
And tells me of her dreams
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
In the dimestores and bus-stations
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
At times I think there are no words
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
But still remains
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
People on the platforms
Thinking of a series of dreams
I was thinking of a series of dreams
And your father, to your sister he explains
Seven days
But, though the masters make the rules
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
He's not selling any alibis
You been hurt so many times
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
With a fantastic collection of stamps
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Well, the ragman draws circles
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And so Patty calls the cops
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
"Not me," said the man whose fists
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
We living in times when men commit crimes
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Now, you must provide some answers
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
And the poor white remains
Glide across the lonely years
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
I try to tell it like it is
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
To memorizing politics
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Statues made of matchsticks
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
And the princess and the prince discuss
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Wants eleven dollar bills
Six-time losers
And then complains
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
You can fall down on your knees
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
You know that he has no intentions
That it's you and no one else that owns
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
The cowboy angel rides
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
They tell me revenge is sweet
You are there in the flickering light
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
Without any doubt
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
I got into the driver's seat
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Like a corkscrew to my heart
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
You're gonna get hit
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Keep me set apart
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I'm on the pavement
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Plants in the bed, but
Everything is always right
We can hold up a toast if we meet
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And, since my feet are now fast
So he never thinks straight
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
With your pockets well protected at last
Our Father would not like the way that you act
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
To keep it in your mind and not forget
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Everyone still talks about
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
To hold each other tight
Wait for the morning light
The slow one now will later be fast
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
One more night the moon is shining bright
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Someday, everything is gonna be different
They tell me to be discreet
There's some people that
And I, in my armor, turning about
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Talking that the heat put
You used to laugh–make fun about
By the way, that's a cute hat
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And the first one now will later be last
One more night I will wait for the light
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
How many years can a mountain exist
She seems too far out
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
He built a fire on Main Street
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
You used to laugh about
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
How many years can some people exist
The slowest now will later be fast
In the stillness of the midnight
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Keep it in your mind and not forget
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
He really wasn't where it's at
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
That might be all that you got
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I think that it's best
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
You're hearing my heart beat
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
But, if the arrow is straight
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
I soon get some rest
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
In the precious winds they rot
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Johnny's in the basement
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
It don't take too long to find out
You don't forget
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
And I tell this truth to you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I just might have to come see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
It's just crazy being here with you
I can be just like you
I'll remember you
To protect you and defend you
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To be alone with you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
It only goes to show
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
But sooner or later one of us must know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He been living there three years now
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Well, I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
With only you in view
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
I'd sure like to know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Don't it always a-go to show
The only one I know
Don't it always go to show
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Sooner or later one of us must know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
So I run down most hurriedly
She puts it to me plain as day
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Don't you tell Henry
The Spanish-American War had its day
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
And for His love they took His life away
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Went to the doctor the very next day
I send you all my money
She smiles, walks the other way
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
And the only tune my guitar could play
Or if you just want some company
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Though I'd never say
And the ladies treat me kindly
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
How many times must the cannon balls fly
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
That I done it the way
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Spouted out that liberty
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
For them that must obey authority
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
And I'm leaving every day to run away
To those condemned to act accordingly
If I don't take the chance to try
From phony jealousy
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
My mind weaves a symphony
That I was just a puppet in a play
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
He made the bells of freedom ring today
No, you'll not now or no other day
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
But I can't deny
But I wish there was something you would do or say
For them that think death––death's honesty
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
The same thing I would want today
My ears hear a symphony
For them that think death's honesty
So, I'm walking down your highway
A cock is crowing far away
We banged the drum slowly
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Is worth more than I could pay
Maggie says that many say
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
And it's up to you to say
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
But you can never steal away
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
I did not do it harmfully
Well, I'm walking down the highway
And that which you've given me today
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
So they took him to the infirmary
She knocked upon it anyway
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Havana–gee–
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
How badly they were shocked –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
I'm sure it was not three –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Havanagee–luh–
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I got no idea what I want –
First degree and second degree –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Private reasons – great or small –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
I a-hope you can hear––
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Disconnect these cables––
Hang out the whole next day –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Ha–va–
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Oh, my–
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
As suicide remarks are torn –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
I hope that you can hear––
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Indians camp along her border –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I long to hold you in the night –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
To know where you are –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
With notions his canoe was laden –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Leave all the children home –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Ten thousand miles or more –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Haven't seen her since that night –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Though its glow is waxed in black –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
You will not hear a laugh –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Hava–na–
Turn, turn, turn again –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
