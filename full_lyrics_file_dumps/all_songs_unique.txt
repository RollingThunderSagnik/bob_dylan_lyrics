They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!

We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Get me outta here, my dear man!

Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!

I figured they was in my TV set!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Take me down to California, baby!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
My God, they killed Him!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I wanna be yours!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Yes, come out your window!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!

It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Alright!

Looking for my lo and behold!
They was all over!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Start over!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Yeah, man!
Thank you!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Yippee!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Howdy, East Orange!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!

Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Good God!

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Lordy, Lord!
She's insane!
Oh, yeah!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Well!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
How they ever flood my soul!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Woo!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
You're a liar!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
We want folksingers here."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
It's all for the love of thee."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
They look as white as snow."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
We'll both go home together."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
That you must always first forgive them."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
I'll endow them onto thee."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
I love far better than thee."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Tangled up in blue."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
And have it on Highway 61."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
And punched my cigarette."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
"That way down Highway 61."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
You can't blame us at all."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And hung on a willow tree."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
And it's all for the love of thee."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I can't find my knees."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
You must know about my debutante."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
We'll both go off together."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Will mourn for your return."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
You can't blame me at all."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
I'll bring back my lady."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Have it on Highway 61."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
I'll see her soon, I know."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
And keep him good company."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Get on your horse and ride away."
He said, "Tell me about it."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
I would want again tomorrow."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
I didn't see you around."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
"I've had too much of your company,"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
"Is it easy to forget?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And pretend that you never have met."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Would kill a little bird like me."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
But we were tangled up in blue."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Come flowing down so free?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
But I know what you want."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
You and I'll never know."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
For that reason I will have to stay."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
So write to her tenderly."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
They look as dark as night."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Where you and I will unite."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Country'll grow."
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
If ever I prove false to you,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Each time we meet, love,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
It's rising up above my head,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Waiting for the trains,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Come all without, come all within,
When she lays upon the grass,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Three angels up above the street,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
But the bottles are done,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Read books and repeat quotations,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Since you've been gone,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Don't let her see,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Don't know what to do without it,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Keep me where you are,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
For her to arrive,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
I'd already gone the distance,
Said I'm pressing on,
One by one they follow the sun,
So many roads, so much at stake,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
While paupers change possessions,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Went back home to the yard,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Where the neon madmen climb,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Going, going,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
To hang and to lynch,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
They took a clean-cut kid,
You have explained every mystery,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
That fired the gun,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
The kingdoms of experience,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
I got no place left to turn,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Now, won't you tell me true,
God knows how to make it flow,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
If anything is gonna sell,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
And there's two white horses following me,
You will be alright, girl,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
They say every man must fall,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
We never much thought we could get very old,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Go down to the river, babe,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
He's the property of Jesus,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
I had no one for to go my bail,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
I been riding the midnight train,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
"Not I," said the referee,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Oh, see what you can do,
Get back, write Braille,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Just don't know what to do,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
How he died nobody can say,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
If I didn't have to guess,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Don't let yourself fall,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Looking 'bout the government,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I couldn't see where we were going,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Someone to open each and every door,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
In the lonely night,
But, if you want me to,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
You have given all there is to give,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
I don't want to meet your kin,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Don't let her hear,
I've been in and out of happiness,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
I could have left this town by noon,
God knows it's outta sight,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
To be––direction home,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I went into the red, went into the black,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
At the close of the day,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
But, to remain as friends,
With what your fate is going to be,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
In the darkness of my night,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
First to come in was the flying moth,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
I can make it through,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
In the foggy web of destiny,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
And you know I could never be your own,
Each one playing a horn,
And not going through any great extreme,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Poor boy never say die,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Holding his club like he was a king,
But I know that he don't talk,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
You were striped, you were plain,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
They walk among the stately trees,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
My hands can't feel to grip,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
And gathering storms may arise,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Someone to close his heart,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Get born, keep warm,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Need a woman all the time,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
I wish tonight were here,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
That two healers cannot heal him,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
You have given me eyes to see,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
And furnish me with tape,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
She got great big hind legs,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
The Second World War came to an end,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Carved next to his name,
Watered-down love,
A hand set the spark,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
But I'm saved,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
So, never leave me lonely,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Broken idols, broken heads,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
The only son of God Almighty,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
You were snow, you were rain,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
I'd only have to stay,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Going, going, gone,
That you'd have liked me to,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
A thousand miles from home,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Of this I can't say very much,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Love don't have any place,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Just like a rolling stone,
All the silver, all the gold,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
He's young and on fire,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
A true love of mine,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
And you make love just like a woman,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
I can't cross the line, you know,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Looking for a new fool,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Strangers all give me the news,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
That her father was going to hang,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Wintertime in New York town,
For she ain't the same,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
And to come every time you call,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
There she come, now, down my way,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Can't find what I need,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Madams light the candles,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
And it's like I ain't here,
I got a wife and five little children,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
All that and more and then some,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
How does it feel,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
High water rising, rising night and day,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I want you,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Watching the river flow,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Without ideals or violence,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
I'm so glad,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
A million faces at my feet,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
I once held her in my arms,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
And here I sit so patiently,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Well, come all without, come all within,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
With the juice running down my leg,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
I get my sweet reward,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
"Come along and take a trip,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
One by one until there were none,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
It's like I ain't here,
People talk over situations,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Living in the land of Nod,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
I think we better talk this over,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Tell me,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
I shall be released,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I swung on to my old guitar,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Is it really any wonder,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
But, if I can save you any time,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Front door shut, back door too,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Don't mind the driving rain,
As the present now will later be past,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
You gotta look some other place,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
I can't be good, baby,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Mixing up the medicine,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
The wind blowing the snow around,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Don't matter what you did,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Never weak, but always strong,
Nothing too very scientific,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Got my mind made up,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
God knows it's a struggle,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
But now morning is clear,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
It hurts me, too,
By rivers of blindness,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Baby, let me follow you down,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
I want you so bad,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
We've killed each one,
A question in your nerves is lit,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
My limbs are shaking,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Well, I'm so glad,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
The country music station plays soft,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Make you spin or do you in,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Stone you just like they said they would,
My senses have been stripped,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Five by five they tried to survive,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Not the end, not the end,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Couldn't even see the floor,
And I'm back in the rain,
Tell her not to worry,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Rabbit running down across the road,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
The day you quit me, baby,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
A complete unknown,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
The man in the trench-coat,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
And pretend that we never have touched,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
"Not me," said his manager,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Somewhere down the road some day,
I went into the city, went into the town,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Silhouetted by the sea,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I want my arms around you,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Speaking to some French girl,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
In the hills of mystery,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
If'n you don't know by now,
Face full of black soot,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Never did feel this way before,
You better chew gum,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
I like the way that you move your hips,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
And give him back the time he's done,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Try hard, get barred,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Socialism, hypnotism,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
To gather flowers constantly,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
God knows it's a crime,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
But it ain't me, babe,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Yesterday's just a memory,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Roll, Willie, roll,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
For the politician's gain,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
You to me were true,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Equality, liberty,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Broken hands on broken plows,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
This world is ruled by violence,
To find out if she's talked,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
With no direction home,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Get dressed, get blessed,
In one the surface was frozen,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Stone you and say good luck,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Going,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
That the laws are with him,
Till both of us fell by the way,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
God knows everything,
But the time ain't tall,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Come on, come on, stick together,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
With his fist in a clinch,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
And it's only that I'm asking,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
The phone's tapped anyway,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I have no one to meet,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Who will promise never to part,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Winter would have no spring,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
In the turning of twilight,
She said she would never forget,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Father of black, father of white,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
I'm going back to Colorado,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
But you try with your whole soul,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
If today was not a crooked highway,
I won't have my nature way,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Like as not, it's better so,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
I wish I a-was a magician,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Baby, please stop crying,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
The sky too is folding over you,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
But I'm pressing on,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
But I've been hanging on,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Honey, just for you to climb,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
You don't want a love that's pure,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
If you must cling to someone,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
You could look at it and weep,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
God don't call it wrong,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
But you were gambling for support,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
I would not feel so all alone,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Want you so bad,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
To be so useless and all,
Ye shall be a-changed,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Don't try No Doz,
If you can't quit your sinning,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Already the fiesta has begun,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
On this new morning, new morning,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
For something that he never done,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
God knows there's a river,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Staying far behind without you,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Had no one to go my bail,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Dream about you, baby,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
But, if I will save you the time,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
To keep up his hate,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
It's too bad he had to go,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Thieving in the alley,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
I got my mind made up,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
It's a price I have to pay,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Icicles hanging down,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
But something has changed,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Wasn't making any great connection,
You don't have to feed me,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
The joint is jumping,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Carry the New York Times,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
I'm going out of my mind,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
God sees it all unfold,
Heart of mine, be still,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
We live and we die, we know not why,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
She said she would always stay,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
And on the highway of regret,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Look who's back in town,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
You came down on me like white thunder,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Father of air and father of trees,
God knows it's fragile,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Cares not to come up any higher,
All the tired horses in the sun,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
God knows there's a purpose,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
They tell me every man must fall,
My hands didn't touch him none,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
And I'm so glad,
Corrina, Corrina,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
You came, you saw, just like the law,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
While riding on a train going west,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
From their fates try to resign,
They say that every man must fall,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
All I really wanna do,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
I never can go because, you know,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
You had enough of hatred,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Saved,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
More people kept a-piling on,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
That must be what it's all about,
Thinking about the government,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
And played the fife lowly,
Vanished from my hand,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
But he's the property of Jesus,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Or have done something wrong,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
True love, they've been without it,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
And I––I walk out on my own,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Like a rolling stone,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Why she did go,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Trouble,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I try my best to be just like I am,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Memory, ecstasy,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
First degree and second degree,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Loyalty, unity,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
That one doctor cannot save him,
The one we can see and can feel,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Seven days,
Relationships of ownership,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Where life and death are memorized,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Ye shall be changed,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Well, I may just swear,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Joey, Joey,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Don't you tell Henry,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
We live in a political world,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Every brain is civilized,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
May you stay forever young,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
To have––be on your own,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Ever since I been a child,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Like a complete unknown,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Says he's got a bad cough,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
It always has hit me from below,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Well, I can't understand,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
I've been saved – well, alright,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Is looking for a new fool,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
To know how much I really care,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
King of the streets, child of clay,
And the whole world is on your case,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Don't ever try to change me,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
But ye shall be a-changed,
My dear, sweet friend,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
And I'm in the shade,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
No direction home,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
They keep it all hid,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
I need a shot of love,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
For his age he is wise,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Circled by the circus sands,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
To be out on your own,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
It was from her ship sailing,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Read books, repeat quotations,
And I'm just like that bird,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
God knows you've got to weep,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
He won't do nothing to you,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
You need something to open your eyes,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Out to the windy beach,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
So glad,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Well, get sick, get well,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
With his candle lit into the sun,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
When all will be well,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
I'll go see them come down my way,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Made of silver or of golden,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
I should have left this town this morning,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
They say every man must need protection,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
May be an actor in a plot,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
I went down where the vultures feed,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Made before the foundation of the world,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Poor boy dressed in black,
For all intended purposes,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
The light I never knowed,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
In the instant that I preach,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
When the night comes falling,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Heart of mine,
That they do not respect in any degree,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
You got to serve somebody,
And the point is slick,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I had a dream about you, baby,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
God don't call it treason,
Like a dog on a chain,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
And I got those worried blues,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
On the stone that remains,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Like some mystery,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Try to be a success,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
And also by his feet,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
People talk of situations,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Father of day, father of night,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
I fell down to my bended knees,
They––they show me to the door,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Over the hills and far away,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Precious father, loving mother,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
You got something better,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Alright, I'm so glad,
The country doctor rambles,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Into my own parade,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
The air is getting hotter,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I been good,
To be alone with you,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
You and me, we had completeness,
And all of your children start to resent you,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
The beat is pumping,
To shine in through,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
He's not selling any alibis,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Far away in the stormy night,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Badge out, laid off,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
But, deep inside my heart,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Under the microscope,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
God knows it's true,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Of ancient history,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
You even make love just like a woman,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
I love you, pretty baby,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Far away and over the wall,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Watch the river flow,
At ships with tattooed sails,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
All you can do is do what you must,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
As his youth now unfolds,
If she ain't feeling well,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Yet every distance is not near,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
How he died nobody could say,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
But evidently she don't,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
This situation can only get rougher,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
My arms and legs were broken,
People carry roses,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Is used, it is plain,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
New morning,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
And she'll be coming forth,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
In love and with kindness,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
They say everything can be replaced,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
They say every man need protection,
Eh, see what you can do,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Watch the plain-clothes,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
And forget my pride,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
She'll be coming forth,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
To protect his white skin,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
It's alright,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
So unknown,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
It all seemed so well-timed,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Searching everywhere I know,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Just then the order came to charge,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
My love, she speaks softly,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,

That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
No, nothing was delivered,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,

Mercury, gravity,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Far away from it all,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,

I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,

I got two white horses following me,
Baby, thank you for my tea,

Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Every head is so dignified,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",

Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
I've been around this whole country,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
If you throw it all away,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
We'll fly the night away,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Eh, singing just for you,
Over your senses you have no control,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Forever young, forever young,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
When I seen him lose control,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
A foreign sound to your ear,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I went into the city, into the town,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
You made it there somehow,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Without a dream in my heart,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
I know I can't win,
Laying low,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Automobile coming into style,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
A man with a badge skips by,
Stay away from the train line,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
So I got those worries blues,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Pressing on,
But it would not be new,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Private reasons, great or small,
The path you've endured has been rough,
God knows there's a heaven,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I march in the parade of liberty,
By users, cheaters,
And come every time you call,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Who among them would try to impress you,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Turn your back, wash your hands,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
You can raise up your right hand,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
With a killer's pride, security,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Don't follow leaders,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
I can see the turning of the key,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Up and down the block,
It's really something,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
I got a bird that whistles,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
You have given me life to live,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Bring the wife and family,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
To be without a home,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
They pass by so silently,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Hang around the ink-well,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Yes, and I'll go last,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
China doll, alcohol,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
She'll surely turn to white,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
When you think that you've lost everything,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
May be living in another country under another name,
I'd be sad and blue,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I'm leaving today,
When there is no more,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Too serious to fool,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
The night passed away so quickly,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I had so much left to do,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
I just don't know what to do,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
That five walls cannot hide him,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
A handle hid out in the dark,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
To strict party-platform ties,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
And may you stay forever young,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
True love of mine,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
To be on your own,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
It's not aimed at anyone,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Well, there ain't no going back,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
You're beautiful to me,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Without your sweet love,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Six months on the chain gang,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Nothing was delivered,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
I can change, I swear,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
You want watered-down love,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Oh, singing just for you,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Grandpa died last week,
Tell me that you love me only,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I just keep pressing on,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Some things are too hot to touch,
The sky too is folding under you,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
To your tambourine in time,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
If you'd see me this way,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
You have given everything to me,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
I can finish this alone, honey,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
God knows when,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
And she aches just like a woman,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Simplify you, classify you,
Using every angle under the sun,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
And the table's full and overflowed,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
My love, she speaks like silence,
And every cause that ever I fought,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
God knows that, when you see it,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Hmm, I can make it through,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
And comes to a permanent stop,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I went down to scrub and rub,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Too noble to neglect,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Where I will always be renewed,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
And to come each time you call,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Keep a clean nose,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
She leave by the other and roam,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Just remember that death is not the end,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Advertising signs, they con,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
You got something I want plenty of,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Father of night, father of day,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
The train leaves at half past ten,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
That fellow who never blushes,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Well, I don't mind dying,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
I went out last night to take a little round,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
As human gods aim for their mark,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Look out, kid,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Giving back all of what you owe,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
You need something to open up a new door,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Oh, Angelina,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Friends with you,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I got those worried blues,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
It could even be like a myth,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
A dream about you, baby,
Well, well, well,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Don't wanna be a bum,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
You'll be doing society a favor,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
To stay closer than any friend,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
But I would not feel so all alone,
All them prophets good and gone,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Trust yourself,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Just to know that you are near,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Aim well, my little one,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
In the little church a-this side of town,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Oh, watered-down love,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
They run a brick and tile company,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
They must bust in early May,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
I just say no thanks,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Just like I did before,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I threw it all away,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
In a pine box for all eternity,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
It still ain't me, babe,
In the great unknown,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
As the daylight hours do increase,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
God knows it's terrifying,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
My woman needs it every day,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Gonna serve somebody,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
I bless the day I found you,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Human gods aim for their mark,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
The night blows cold and rainy,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
There's always someone who understands,
By losers, cheaters,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
People going down to the ground,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Serve somebody,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
But it ain't him to blame,
I'll be on my way,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Drag you down or drain you down,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
And she makes love just like a woman,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
To be one your own,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Don't wear sandals,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Light yourself a candle,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
But he can't be blamed,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Go away from my window,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
She never does me wrong,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Stripping away at it all,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
When I was in Missouri,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
But you're doing it again,
Broken threads, broken springs,
You've got to serve somebody,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Don't tie no bows,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Love that's pure no accident,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
And think they're fooling you,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
It don't matter what you did,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Better jump down the manhole,
Father who build the mountain so high,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
She's opened up a happy home,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
If your time to you is worth saving,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Better jump down a manhole,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Look away, you rolling river,
I rambled out of New York town,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
See you fly or watch you die,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
I'm going down the river,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
By the night and been to some place new,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
And, though the line is cut,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
I got the worried blues,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
It was you who came right through,
You'll change your last name, too,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
In his anger and his shame,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
We take great delight in our own company,
Stand up straight and tall,
Resent him to the bone,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
One by one they followed the sun,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
And you take just like a woman,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Without a love of my own,
Searching high, searching low,
Father of minutes, father of days,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
I'm never, never far from home,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Thank You, Lord,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Don't let me change my heart,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Give you my money, honey,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Want you,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Don't let yourself stumble,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
You can run down to the desert,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
If not for you,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Seem like I been down this way before,
And they––they look at me and frown,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Going home,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I'm pledging my time to you,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
The haunted, frightened trees,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
You stole her love from me one day,
And I got the worried blues,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Beating for the dead that rise,
And, if I see the day,
He been around the world and back again,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
It always means so much,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
As I travel down life's pathway,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
That can do what's never been done,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
I try my best to be like I am,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Who could they get to carry you,
I can't understand,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Precious angel under the sun,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
The winter would hold no spring,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Day you quit me, baby,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
You better duck down the alleyway,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Drifting too far from shore,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
The day would surely have to break,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
And point away from the past,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Ain't no going back,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
She once was a true love of mine,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Eh, in somebody's room,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Go melt back in the night,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
They say every man needs protection,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
I thank the Lord,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Don't let me drift too far,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
And, if anybody asks me,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
They say every distance is not near,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
I went back home, put on my tie,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
The night would see me wide awake,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
She would have married me,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
They lowered him down as a king,
Like you never did before,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Only one thing I did wrong,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
To a solid rock,
If you'd see me this a-way,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Or select you or dissect you,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
You married young just like your ma,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
In the end,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Courage is a thing of the past,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Well, I been gambling so long,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
And, although that we're single and free,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
God knows there's a chance,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Democracy don't rule the world --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
That's where you belong --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
I remember her whispering yet.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
You may not see me tomorrow.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
So long, honey babe.
His mama sure was proud of him.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
And the sails are spread.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Who says she knows me well.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
I took some comfort there.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
And I'll go last.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Far down the street we stray.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Yes, and I'll go last.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Without ideals or violence.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
I think this time we should escape.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Oh, convey herself away.
Honey, come and see about me.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.

She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
I don't know.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
Baby, baby.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
68, but says he's 24.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Everything is broken.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
Hmm, tell me.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
In my Cadillac.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I didn't feel so cold then.
I followed the winding stream.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Evidently she won't.
No kindred or relative nigh.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Unless they're from another world.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Havanageeluh.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
I need a shot of love.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
I can't fight them anymore.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
And the Santa Fe.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
The sooner you can go.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.

In the dark land of the sun.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Go find out something only dead men know.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Mine alone.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
You are on the bottom.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.

He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.

Rode slowly back again.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
I see that stationmaster too.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Wants to get it paid off.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Ever since I seen her smile.
While my conscience explodes.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.

She knows too much to argue or to judge.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.

I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Dollar a day's worth.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.

I'm falling in love with you.
"Don't trill no news on me.
Join the army if you fail.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
I just can't beg you anymore.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
And shot it fulla holes.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
And it never seemed strange.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
I know the kinds of things you like.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Come on, baby...
Quicker than anyone I knew.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Oh, her darling love she found.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
From my toes up to my ears.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Honey, I want you.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
He went down to Oxford Town.
The same as my father before him.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
She said she would always stay.
But my heart just won't give in.
Sound like it's on a final run.
'Steada acting like we never met.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
I never saw the man again.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
I hate bears.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
You'll never see me frown.
Under the midnight moon.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
That's the day you die.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
So many people I never saw in my life.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
Figuring a way to get back home.
To be alone with you.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
And disregards the rest.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
She just acts like we never have met.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
I don't even know why we come.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
She's in some foreign land.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Crying out that he been framed.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Drink up your blood like wine.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
If you just let me follow you down.
Now and forever let it be me.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
And laid his life on the line.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
With gold and silver in her hand.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
They got – all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
Like you never done before.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Said it was a bad dream.
The light I never knowed.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Duality, mortality.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
In the night the price was paid.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Come on, honey.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
I know something is changed.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
That Johanna's not here.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
I shall be released.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Go lightly on the ground.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
Even the softest touch.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
I'd like to know.
I got trouble in my mind.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Blood on your saddle.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Of every man who put me here.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
But these to tell what's true.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
Bring that bottle over here.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Most of the time.
She pretends like we never have met.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
If not for you.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Crying out that he was framed.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Thank you.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Funny way to start a picnic.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
But you break just like a little girl.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
I'm not the one you need.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Blowing through another no-good town.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Where teardrops fall.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
I'd give anything to be with you.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
See that my grave is kept clean.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Everybody that was hanging out.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
A foreign sound to your ear.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
I can't fire them anymore.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
Oh, got my mind made up.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
For she once was a true love of mine.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
You were always so close and still within reach.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
To hold me in your arms.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
I got nothing left to burn.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
And watch the parking meters.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I scarcely feel the glow.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And I want you to be that woman.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
I just can't keep from crying.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Crumble into one another.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
I know you always say that you agree.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
Until my dying-day.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Oh, Angelina.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
My love winks, she does not bother.

A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.

It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.

Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
But the mountains of the past.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.

And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Headed out for the western skies.
Thanks.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
For me to return to or chase.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Broken voices on broken phones.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
But he sure left here in style.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
You're my honey.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Just what he was talking about.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
We may not make it through the night.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
Good car to drive, after a war.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
He's got his mother's eyes.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
She acts like we never met.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Hope you're ready.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Ever since I seen you there.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Somebody better investigate soon.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
For as long as love will last.
And then unto eternity.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
I long to reach for you in the night.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Looking for the places only they would know.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Put me outta doors.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
You'll do as much for me.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
At the sorority sisters' home.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Soft as music, light as spring.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
If you just let me come home with you.
Without a love of my own.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
And that failure's no success at all.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
Never will want for money.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Remember me to one who lives there.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
You're the only love I've ever known.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
By that soft and shining sea.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
If'n you don't know by now.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
It was a normal day.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
And she'll only know he's dead.
She saw her father's body broken.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
In fond memory appear.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
I used to care, but things have changed.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
New morning.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.

Without this love that we call ours.
You can't win with a losing hand.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.

Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
My mind is breaking.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.

They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Till I come into New York town:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
But there's one promise, darling:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
His epitaph plain:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Serve somebody:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Man is opposed to fair play:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
All lies and jest;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
I find complete love;
So many things that we never will undo;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
About everybody that was hanging out;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Some speak of the future;
Make promises by the hour;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Crumble into one another;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Had to be held down by big police;
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
How many more without any reward?
Baby, can't you tell?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Does he change the course of rivers?
How many more can they afford?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Poor boy, where you been?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Too many people have died?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Has anybody seen my love?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Can I come home with you?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
What's wrong with you this time?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Am I ready?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
When he's standing in front of you?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
And how does it feel?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
What can I do for You?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Why would I want to take your life?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
How come you don't send me no regards?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Are you ready?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
What do you think about that, my friend?
How much poison did they inhale?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ready, George?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
What can I give to You?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
By golly, what more can I say?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Why and what's the reason for?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
That too many people have died?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Does anyone even try?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Across the swamp of time?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Across the swooping plain?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
And one deserving of affection?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
How could they let you go?
What would life be?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What else can a poor boy do?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Have they missed you?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Before you call him a man?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Before they're forever banned?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Before it is washed to the sea?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Before he can see the sky?
Like a rolling stone?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Are you the same person that was here before?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
How does it feel?
To love and follow His direction?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Of everything you see?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Where did you hide your halo?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
What?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Oh, how could you refuse?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Oh, where are you tonight?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
For all these earthly things?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Must everybody bow?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
How's everything in heaven?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
When did you leave heaven?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
How many compared to yesterday?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Is it rolling, Bob?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
How could they ever mistake you?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Baby, can I come home with you?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Why must you always try to make me over?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Where did you lose your wings?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just like a rolling stone?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Before he can hear people cry?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Gal, where you been so long?
How can I live for You?
Can you get back in?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
What good am I?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Before they're allowed to be free?
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
It was put together down in Argentina
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Silvio, silver and gold
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Maybe someday you will understand
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And those whom doom and death had spared
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
All the sweethearts you can hold
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Things would be different the next time we wed
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And then you told me later as I apologized
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Now you don't seem so proud
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
He was a clean-cut kid
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Nothing was delivered
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
I will not go down under the ground
But all that suffering was not to be compared
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
There ain't nothing in this world
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Now, a very great man once said
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
I thought that it was well-understood
Just what you had in mind
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
To see him obviously framed
Standing on the water, casting your bread
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
So I'll make my stand
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
It's something you did
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
I want you, baby, just to understand
But now something has changed
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
We live in a political world
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
I had to say something to strike him very weird
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
Now you don't act so––so proud
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Many times I've often prayed
But she ain't gonna find the road
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
And things would be different the next time we wed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
The changes I was going through can't even be used
As I stand upon the sand
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
I run right home and I went to bed
Everything stays down where it's wounded
They took a clean-cut kid
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
And your trouble is you know it too good
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Somebody seen him hanging around
"Equality". I spoke the word
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Its iron claws attached
You try so hard, but you don't understand
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
I'll always thank the Lord
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
By no special friend
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
I live in another world
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Then came the warning that was before the flood
But something has changed
She let go of my hand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
While some, on principles baptized
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
You used to be so amused
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
How many times can a man turn his head
For what you sold that's not been received
Now, whenever I get up and
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
I've been walking around
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
And into the path you are hurled
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
You used––be so proud
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
If dogs run free, why not we
See the primitive wallflower freeze
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
You know, it's not even safe no more
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Feel to moan, but unlike before
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
She knows there's no success like failure
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
What good am I then to others and me
But I feel nothing for their game
And I ain't complaining none
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Well, six white horses that you did promise
The crashing waves roll over me
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
It's all new to me
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
So up she picked her babies three
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
They say don't come back no more
It'll be with me unto the grave
Taking care of somebody nice
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
You into thinking you're the one
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Remember me to the one who lives there
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
But I can't say I sympathize
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And you see why it's so unique to be
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Remember me to one who lives there
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
A bed that is never mine
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
You just pick anyone
I'm sure you're the one to blame
To show you something you seen before
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
While them that defend what they cannot see
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Up into some paradise
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
When the roses fade
Though its shadow's metal badge
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Knows there's no success like failure
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
I do declare
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Just pick anyone
If dogs run free, why not me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
On the rising curve
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
From all the plans they do pursue
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And plenty time for good romance
The man the authorities came to blame
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Con you into thinking that you're the one
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
If dogs run free, then what must be
Better stay away from those
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
So, I called up the operator of time
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
She plunged him into well water where
What's probably got you baffled more
As he rises to fame
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Mona tried to tell me
You said you'd never compromise
Among the lovely people living free
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
A girl who would murder her own, true love
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Should I leave them by your gate
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
There were times when I was so lonesome
How many ears must one man have
"That I might be gone a long, old time
You cut to the core
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
With all memory and fate
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
So I look like a walking mountain range
She been gone
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
You say you're looking for someone
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
I rode with him in a taxi once
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
And never sat once at the head of the table
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Hunger pays a heavy price
Lies that life is black-and-white
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
All I feel is heat and flame
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
So I remember every face
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
But the dark does die
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
That she's the same one
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I can survive and I can endure
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
"It's only you that he does crave
When the rain is blowing in your face
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Full of hope and desire
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Waiting to find out what price
Limited in sex they dare
You could almost think that you're seeing double
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Little did I realize
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
I don't even notice she gone
From the start by the rule
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And I'm just the same as anyone else
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
When I'm all alone
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
How was I to know you'd be the one
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And I would send a message
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
He'll see by his grave
Most of the time I can't even be sure
We see this empty cage now corrode
What you're gonna say when you get home
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Should I put them by your gate
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
To give the special one you seek a chance
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
I am homeless, come and take me
I'm ready for to fade
You smiling through the fence at me
The cause was there before we came
It's getting dark, too dark to see
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
You're not free to belong to me
I been wondering all about me
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
What about that millionaire
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
And suddenly there appeared before me
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
At dawn my lover comes to me
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Well, it's all new to me
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Just what you will say when you get home
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
But I can get another one
And the Negro's name
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Says it's closing time
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
I can hear their hearts a-beating
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Where the time and the tempo drag
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
For your weary toes to be touching
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Early in the morning, early in the morning
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
You left me standing in the doorway crying
The battle outside raging
Deceived me into thinking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
But then a whistle will be blowing
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I know that you know that I know that you show something
It's not a bad way to make a living
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
There's nothing in here moving
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And there's no telling who that it's naming
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
'Cause the battle outside raging
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The order is a-rapidly fading
What am I saying? What am I knowing
The order is rapidly fading
If I was with her too long
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
She rode by night and came by morning
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
They're drinking up and walking
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Well, I set my monkey on the log
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Beyond here lies nothing
And how I know I'll make it through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Then she told us how times were tough
You go north and you go south
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Look out, the saints are coming through
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I have fallen far beneath
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You turn around to take a final peek
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Shoot in the back
Well, there ain't no going back
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
But they caught him and they brought him back
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Her voice once and talk
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
I wish she'd unlock
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
The man in me will do nearly any task
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
A girl by the whirlpool
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
But among the dead that were left on the hill
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Ring bar, hard to tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Then why don't she tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
They ask me how I feel
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
He's sure got a lot of gall
Ring bell, hard to tell
A-how does it feel
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Soul to soul our shadows roll
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
All and all can only fall
As the last fire-truck from hell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
How many seas must the white dove sail
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
How does it feel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
He's taught in his school
And if my love is real
How many seas must a white dove sail
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Muttering small talk at the wall
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Oh, how does it feel
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And remain as I am
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
"For you cannot relive them
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
You better not chew gum
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Two eyes took the aim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But I can hear another drum
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
From heights that they could not gain
Nothing we can call our own
To my knowledge there's just one man
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Darkness at the break of noon
And you ache a-just like a woman
Suicide remarks are torn
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
But the second mother was with the seventh son
There was little to say, there was no conversation
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
As they rode him in custody down to the station
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
And the corner sign
Have died in battle or in vain
The ones that jump on the wagon
But the post office has been stolen
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
And she wakes just like a woman
She got such a sweet disposition
I figure maybe we're even
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
I don't even care if I ever see her again
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
And there's no exit in any direction
As you sit on the box you keep him in
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
For the loser now might be later to win
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
And the smell of their roses does not remain
My love, she's like some raven
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Guns and clubs followed him down
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Why did you trade heaven
The foreign sun, it squints upon
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
But me, I expected it to happen
Yet I swear I see my reflection
All their daughters put me down
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
How many roads must a man walk down
He got that fortress on the mountain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
"Not me," said the gambling man
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
The next morning she had awoken
How can the life of such a man
Yes, and someone must explain
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Well, you fake just like a woman
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Trying to get a lead on
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
And she aches just like a woman
For the loser now will be later to win
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
But it's hard to think on
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
All lay down their bandanas and complain
In ceremonies of the horsemen
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
To remember the times when I was your only man
She takes just like a woman
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
But the second mom was with the seventh son
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
But I swear I see my reflection
Must meet the dawn
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Somebody new to beat on
A-she takes just like a woman
You don't need a weatherman
She said that all the railroad men
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Well, I'm hanging on
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Their religion of the little ten women
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
That long, black train is pulling on down
You need something to make it known
And all their daughters put me down
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Advertising signs that con
But all their daughters put me down
I'll be waiting at the station
You take just like a woman
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
That long, black train is pulling down
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Out of the shower comes a football man
In the pigpen
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Silvio, I gotta go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Every place I wanna go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
There is a place you go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
There's nothing you can say or do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
All I really wanna do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All I'd like you to do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
The man in the coon-skin cap
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
How many times must a man look up
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
I walked down there and ended up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Aladdin and his lamp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Man in the coon-skin cap
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
What good am I while you softly weep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
The face of God will appear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
When only you are near
I don't have to go far
So, don't fear if you hear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
I say, "Why you say that for
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
She took him by his long, yellow hair
The lover who has just walked out your door
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
I could feel a whole lot better
In one I was running and in another
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
For I am married to a house carpenter
My ship is in the harbor
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
For all eternity I think I will remember
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
The wind howls like a hammer
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Still I've always kind of missed her
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
At any moment you could go under
When you whispered in my ear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Alone you stand with nobody near
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
You heard me saying a prayer for
Still I say her love-words over
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
But morning is clear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I close my eyes and I wonder
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
Never no more do I wonder
And I don't even think about her
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Who came here from Cuba's door
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
All you boys better run for cover
And the princess and the prince discuss
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
As friends and other strangers
Thinking of a series of dreams
The cowboy angel rides
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I try to tell it like it is
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
And, though the masters make the rules
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
People carry roses
To memorizing politics
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
What good am I if I say foolish things
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
I'm gonna let you pass
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
I'd gladly confess
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And I try to harmonize with songs
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Her window's wide open, African trees
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And the poor white remains
And without further notice asks you how it feels
You should be made to wear earphones
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
True love can make a blade of grass
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Good and bad, I define these terms
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
You know that he has no intentions
To sharpen the senses
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
That it's you and no one else that owns
Don't wear sandals
We living in times when men commit crimes
You can fall down on your knees
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
They whisper in the wings
Mama, you know, awaits the news
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
And tells me of her dreams
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
How many deaths will it take till he knows
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
People on the platforms
Girl by the whirlpool's
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
But, though the masters make the rules
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
And your father, to your sister he explains
Glide across the lonely years
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Romantic facts of musketeers
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And so Patty calls the cops
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Six-time losers
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Six-time users
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Statues made of matchsticks
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Now, you must provide some answers
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Don't follow leaders
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
And then complains
When your mother sends back all your invitations
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Wants eleven dollar bills
To the cutting of fences
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Seven days
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
He's not selling any alibis
I was thinking of a series of dreams
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
At times I think there are no words
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
With a big bouquet of the roses
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And inside it with the people made of molasses
But still remains
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
You been hurt so many times
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
You never turned around to see the frowns
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Well, the ragman draws circles
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Like a corkscrew to my heart
The slowest now will later be fast
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
That might be all that you got
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Well, early in the morning till late at night
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And I, in my armor, turning about
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
I think that it's best
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Johnny's in the basement
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
So he never thinks straight
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And the first one now will later be last
Wait for the morning light
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
You don't forget
Keep me set apart
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Without any doubt
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
You are there in the flickering light
I got into the driver's seat
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
To hold each other tight
I soon get some rest
Everything is always right
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
You used to laugh about
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
And, since my feet are now fast
In the precious winds they rot
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
In the stillness of the midnight
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Oh, everybody's got to eat
With your pockets well protected at last
By the way, that's a cute hat
Talking that the heat put
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
You're hearing my heart beat
How many years can some people exist
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
You used to laugh–make fun about
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
There's some people that
One more night I will wait for the light
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
But, if the arrow is straight
Someday, everything is gonna be different
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Every new messenger bringing evil report
They tell me revenge is sweet
How many years can a mountain exist
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Everyone still talks about
He built a fire on Main Street
One more night the moon is shining bright
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
She seems too far out
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
The slow one now will later be fast
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
You're gonna get hit
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
I'm moving after midnight
To keep it in your mind and not forget
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
He really wasn't where it's at
Plants in the bed, but
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
They tell me to be discreet
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I'm on the pavement
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
It don't take too long to find out
To be alone with you
I can be just like you
It's just crazy being here with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To protect you and defend you
I just might have to come see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
And I tell this truth to you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
He been living there three years now
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
It only goes to show
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Well, I'd sure like to know
The only one I know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
But sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Don't it always go to show
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
I'd sure like to know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Sooner or later one of us must know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Down every street there's a window
With only you in view
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Don't it always a-go to show
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the ladies treat me kindly
So they took him to the infirmary
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
My ears hear a symphony
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
And for His love they took His life away
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
The Spanish-American War had its day
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
And the only tune my guitar could play
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Went to the doctor the very next day
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Well, I saw it advertised one day
For them that think death's honesty
She puts it to me plain as day
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
So, I'm walking down your highway
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
A cock is crowing far away
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Spouted out that liberty
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
To those condemned to act accordingly
Maggie says that many say
She knocked upon it anyway
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
That I was just a puppet in a play
For them that must obey authority
And I'm leaving every day to run away
If I don't take the chance to try
My mind weaves a symphony
We banged the drum slowly
Or if you just want some company
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Don't you tell Henry
Is worth more than I could pay
But I can't deny
I send you all my money
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
For them that think death––death's honesty
Someone to get you flowers constantly
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
How many times must the cannon balls fly
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
From phony jealousy
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
And that which you've given me today
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
But I wish there was something you would do or say
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
She starts to speak, but he walks away
And it's up to you to say
She smiles, walks the other way
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
He made the bells of freedom ring today
I did not do it harmfully
No, you'll not now or no other day
But you can never steal away
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Though I'd never say
The same thing I would want today
That I done it the way
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
So I run down most hurriedly
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Hava–na–
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Thank––
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Haven't seen her since that night –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Whispering your secret emotion –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
You will not hear a laugh –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Havanagee–luh–
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Ten thousand miles or more –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
First degree and second degree –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Hang out the whole next day –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Oh, my–
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Turn, turn, turn again –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
I got no idea what I want –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
I hope that you can hear––
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Leave all the children home –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Havana–gee–
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Disconnect these cables––
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
I'm sure it was not three –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
To know where you are –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
I long to hold you in the night –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
How badly they were shocked –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
With no other choice except but for to go –
I a-hope you can hear––
Indians camp along her border –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Private reasons – great or small –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Ha–va–
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
