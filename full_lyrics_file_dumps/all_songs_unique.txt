You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Howdy, East Orange!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Lordy, Lord!
Looking for my lo and behold!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Alright!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!

Oh, no!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
Dignity never been photographed!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
They got away!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Hootenanny television!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
I'm in love with you!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
Take me down to California, baby!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Oh!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!

The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Dance!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
I ain't different than anyone!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Yeah, man!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
They was all over!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Woo-hoo!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Oh, yeah!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Yippee!
Betty Ross!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!

Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
So long, New York!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
It was the mailman!

Start over!
You must think I'm crazy!
Woo!
I got the freight train blues!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
I've got a million friends!
Good God!
Play that guitar now!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
He punched me out!
How they ever flood my soul!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yes, come out your window!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Thank you!
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I can't find my knees."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
You can't blame us at all."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
And it's all for the love of thee."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
We want folksingers here."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
And keep him good company."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"That way down Highway 61."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Would kill a little bird like me."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
From across that lonesome ocean."
I'll endow them onto thee."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
And have it on Highway 61."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Country'll grow."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
They look as white as snow."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"Is it easy to forget?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
I would want again tomorrow."
And punched my cigarette."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
I love far better than thee."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
It's all for the love of thee."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
That you must always first forgive them."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
And pretend that you never have met."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
You must know about my debutante."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Get on your horse and ride away."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Tangled up in blue."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
I didn't see you around."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
And hung on a willow tree."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
You and I'll never know."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
But I know what you want."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Where you and I will unite."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
We'll both go home together."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
We'll both go off together."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
You can't blame me at all."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
I'll bring back my lady."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
For that reason I will have to stay."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Come flowing down so free?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
I'll see her soon, I know."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Have it on Highway 61."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
They look as dark as night."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Will mourn for your return."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
So write to her tenderly."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
But we were tangled up in blue."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Like as not, it's better so,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Far away in the stormy night,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
And it ain't me, babe,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
God knows it's outta sight,
It always means so much,
Badge out, laid off,
All I really wanna do,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Too serious to fool,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Fare thee well but for a while,
In the image of someone you used to know,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
That must be what it's all about,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Just then the order came to charge,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
You want watered-down love,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Every brain is civilized,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Corrina, Corrina,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
In the little church a-this side of town,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Made of silver or of golden,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
God knows there's a river,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
To have––be on your own,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Wintertime in New York town,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
He's young and on fire,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Went back home to the yard,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Like a dog on a chain,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
That can do what's a-never been done,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
You got something better,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
When the night comes falling,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
But, to remain as friends,
They say every distance is not near,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Trust yourself,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Keep a clean nose,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
But you were gambling for support,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
But I've been hanging on,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Father of day, father of night,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Stay away from the train line,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
But he can't be blamed,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Every nerve is analyzed,
In the hills of mystery,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Me and Magdalena on the run,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
To be so useless and all,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Light yourself a candle,
Looking for a new fool,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
You've got to serve somebody,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
You will be alright, girl,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
I don't care if you analyze me,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
I don't wanna fake you out,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Alright, I'm so glad,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Hmm, see what you can do,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
A complete unknown,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Without a dream in my heart,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Far away and over the wall,
Resent him to the bone,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
You wanna drown love,
More people kept a-piling on,
Using every angle under the sun,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I never can go because, you know,
They must bust in early May,
And, although that we're single and free,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
If'n you don't know by now,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
All them prophets good and gone,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Laying low,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
The only son of God Almighty,
When I was in Missouri,
Icicles hanging down,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
He got that soft, silky skin,
So I got those worries blues,
I try my best to be like I am,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Silhouetted by the sea,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
People going down to the ground,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
She'll surely turn to white,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
You have given me eyes to see,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Holding his club like he was a king,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
In love and with kindness,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
I wish I a-was a magician,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Precious angel under the sun,
Keep me where you are,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
May be living in another country under another name,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
The joint is jumping,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
I got a wife and five little children,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
You have laid down Your life for me,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Into my own parade,
The one we can see and can feel,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
To know how much I really care,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
In one the surface was frozen,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
True love of mine,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
All the silver, all the gold,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Is used, it is plain,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Try hard, get barred,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Far away from it all,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
I try my best to be just like I am,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Precious father, loving mother,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I thank the Lord,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Heart of mine,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I'd already gone the distance,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
I'd be sad and blue,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Baby, please stop crying,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Looking 'bout the government,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Spent my money on you, honey,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
The winter would hold no spring,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Pressing on,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Go away from my window,
People talk over situations,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
And you know I could never be your own,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
And, though the line is cut,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
No direction home,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
King of the streets, child of clay,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
But evidently she don't,
Ain't no going back,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
God knows everything,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Serve somebody,
And also by his feet,
Broken threads, broken springs,
And to come each time you call,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Thinking about the government,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I like the way that you move your hips,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
And I'm so glad,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
May be an actor in a plot,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Grandpa died last week,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
With no direction home,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
As the daylight hours do increase,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
God knows there's a purpose,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
In the end,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
I can't cross the line, you know,
See her in that very tight skirt,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
To strict party-platform ties,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Courage is a thing of the past,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Drifting too far from shore,
Like you never did before,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Don't put yourself over the line,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
We take great delight in our own company,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I threw it all away,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
I won't have my nature way,
For all intended purposes,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
When I seen him lose control,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Father of loneliness and pain,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Get back, write Braille,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Poor boy dressed in black,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
They say every man needs protection,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
You need something to open up a new door,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Someone to open each and every door,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I been good while I been waiting,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
She leave by the other and roam,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Hang around the ink-well,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
It could even be like a myth,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Three angels up above the street,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
The day you quit me, baby,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Give you my money, honey,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
I wish tonight were here,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
I got those worried blues,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
But, deep inside my heart,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
But you try with your whole soul,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
I got a bird that whistles,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Baby, let me follow you down,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Equality, liberty,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Just like a rolling stone,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Automobile coming into style,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
This situation can only get rougher,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Father of night, father of day,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Look out, kid,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Like some mystery,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Look away, you rolling river,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
For she ain't the same,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
In the great unknown,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Oh, singing just for you,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
I'm leaving today,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
So, never leave me lonely,
And ye shall be a-changed,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Watch the plain-clothes,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
But I'm pressing on,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Or select you or dissect you,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Oxford Town around the bend,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Over the hills and far away,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
You and me, we had completeness,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
To protect his white skin,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
I've been all around the world, boys,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Better jump down a manhole,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
You better chew gum,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
The sky too is folding over you,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
They say every man must fall,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
I went into the red, went into the black,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
God knows there's a heaven,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
To hide 'neath a hood,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
But it ain't me, babe,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
I had a dream about you, baby,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
That can do what's never been done,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It was you who came right through,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Why she did go,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
It's too bad he had to go,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Judge and jury took their stand,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
In the ruins of your balcony,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
I long to see you in the morning light,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Front door shut, back door too,
Ah, get sick, get well,
That you'd have liked me to,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
My woman needs it every day,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Tell me,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
I swung on to my old guitar,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Don't let her see where you're going,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Had no one to go my bail,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
I just can't beg you anymore,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And ride a horse along the trail,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Too noble to neglect,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Day you quit me, baby,
I can change, I swear,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
And may you stay forever young,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
You made it there somehow,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Just to know that you are near,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
But, if you want me to,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Yet every distance is not near,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
He's not selling any alibis,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
I shall be released,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
When she lays upon the grass,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
God knows when,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
To your tambourine in time,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Well, I'm so glad,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Mixing up the medicine,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
With what your fate is going to be,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Mercury, gravity,
Go down to the river, babe,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
My senses have been stripped,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
For her to arrive,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
When all will be well,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
A man with a badge skips by,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
All you can do is do what you must,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
God knows there's a chance,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
But you're doing it again,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
I went down to scrub and rub,
When there is no more,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Carved next to his name,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
The air is getting hotter,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Stone you when you are young and able,
My existence led by confusion boats,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Don't follow leaders,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Bring the wife and family,
God don't call it treason,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
And I got the worried blues,
And played the fife lowly,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
You even make love just like a woman,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
But now morning is clear,
The night would see me wide awake,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Dream about you, baby,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
There she come, now, down my way,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
I can make it through,
On this new morning, new morning,
Puffing on a big cigar,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Well, well, well,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Tell me that you love me only,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Staying far behind without you,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
They say that every man must fall,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
In his anger and his shame,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Look who's back in town,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Every head is so dignified,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
And here I sit so patiently,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
It was from her ship sailing,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
You need something to open your eyes,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
And to come every time you call,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Just as long as you stay with me,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
How does it feel,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Want you,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
You always responded when I needed your help,
If you throw it all away,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
God sees it all unfold,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
At ships with tattooed sails,
And I got those worried blues,
From their fates try to resign,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Eh, in somebody's room,
My dear, sweet friend,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
To keep up his hate,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Like a rolling stone,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
I rambled out of New York town,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
True love, they've been without it,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
It's really something,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Where life and death are memorized,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Never weak, but always strong,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
I'm going back to Colorado,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
A true love of mine,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Give what I got until I got no more,
God knows that, when you see it,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Speaking to some French girl,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Just like I did before,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Saved,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Come all without, come all within,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
She said she would never forget,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Thank You, Lord,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
You got to serve somebody,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
She got great big hind legs,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Watered-down love,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
It's a price I have to pay,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
You were striped, you were plain,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
You broke a heart that loved you,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
It don't matter what you did,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Don't let her see,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Six months on the chain gang,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
I once held her in my arms,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
They walk among the stately trees,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
With a killer's pride, security,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
To be alone with you,
Don't let her hear,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
You stole her love from me one day,
But he's the property of Jesus,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
You're beautiful to me,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
She never does me wrong,
In the shadows of moonlight,
The phone's tapped anyway,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
New morning,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Come on, come on, stick together,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Don't wanna be a bum,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
And forget my pride,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Now you don't talk so loud,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Private reasons, great or small,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
One more night the stars are in sight,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Beyond here lies nothing,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Silvio, I gotta go,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Of ancient history,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Whether you are right or wrong,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
With the juice running down my leg,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
As his youth now unfolds,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Dust on my face and my cape,
And they––they look at me and frown,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Without ideals or violence,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
But the time ain't tall,
And furnish me with tape,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Living in the land of Nod,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
A million faces at my feet,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Don't steal, don't lift,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
To be––direction home,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
First degree and second degree,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Strangers all give me the news,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Get born, keep warm,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Make you spin or do you in,
Well, get sick, get well,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
With his fist in a clinch,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
For the politician's gain,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
For something that he never done,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Searching everywhere I know,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
God knows it's fragile,
I had no one for to go my bail,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
To be out on your own,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
You can raise up your right hand,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
I'm going out of my mind,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
I'm going down the river,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
You have given all there is to give,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I just say no thanks,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Not the end, not the end,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Don't try No Doz,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Read books, repeat quotations,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
My love, she speaks like silence,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
I tried to reach you, honey,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Two by two they step in the dark,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Well, I can't understand,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
If today was not a crooked highway,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
It all seemed so well-timed,
They say every man need protection,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Where I will always be renewed,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
And give him back the time he's done,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
"Not I," said the referee,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
I can't be good, baby,
"Not me," said his manager,
I need a shot of love,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
You married young just like your ma,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
The day would surely have to break,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Adiós, mi corazón,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
To hang and to lynch,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
All the tired horses in the sun,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
And, if I can save you any time,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Is looking for a new fool,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
The sky too is folding under you,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Without a love of my own,
I went out last night to take a little round,
That five walls cannot hide him,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
I'll be on my way,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Don't you tell Henry,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
We never much thought we could get very old,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
I been good,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
To be one your own,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Wasn't making any great connection,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
The path you've endured has been rough,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Says he's got a bad bill,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Yes, I'm so glad,
To a solid rock,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Face full of black soot,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
They don't believe in mercy,
Nothing was delivered,
You'll change your last name, too,
Beating for the dead that rise,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
As the present now will later be past,
I went into the city, went into the town,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Got me a secret membership card,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Got my mind made up,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Vanished from my hand,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
In another I witnessed a crime,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
God knows you've got to weep,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
While paupers change possessions,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
He been around the world and back again,
A foreign sound to your ear,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
We live and we die, we know not why,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Want you so bad,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I have no one to meet,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Don't wear sandals,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
She said she would always stay,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Ye shall be changed,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
You gotta look some other place,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
You don't want a love that's pure,
We'll fly the night away,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Love don't have any place,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Just remember that death is not the end,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
At the close of the day,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
We live in a political world,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Don't tie no bows,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Oh, Angelina,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Pick you up every time you fall,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Love that's pure no accident,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Makes no difference where she's been,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
To be without a home,
No, nothing was delivered,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
I got my mind made up,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
That fellow who never blushes,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I got no place left to turn,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
If she ain't feeling well,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
All that and more and then some,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Never did feel this way before,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Precious memories, how they linger,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
You don't have to feed me,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Carry the New York Times,
They say everything can be replaced,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
And, if anybody asks me,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
God knows it's terrifying,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
God knows it's a struggle,
I just don't know what to do,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
When you think that you've lost everything,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Is it really any wonder,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Don't let yourself fall,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
One by one until there were none,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Heart of mine, be still,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Loyalty, unity,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Stone you just like they said they would,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Seven days,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
The Second World War came to an end,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
See you fly or watch you die,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
I been riding the midnight train,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Nothing too very scientific,
Who will promise never to part,
The country doctor rambles,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
And there's two white horses following me,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
And I'm in the shade,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Hazel, you called and I came,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Waiting for the trains,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
And gathering storms may arise,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Father of black, father of white,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
How many a year has passed and gone,
This place ain't doing me any good,
A hand set the spark,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Drag you down or drain you down,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
And, if I see the day,
They––they show me to the door,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
They tell me every man must fall,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Need a woman all the time,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
You to me were true,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
The country music station plays soft,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
I can't understand,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
"Come along and take a trip,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
You could look at it and weep,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
I should have left this town this morning,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
But, it ain't me, babe,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
First to come in was the flying moth,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
And the table's full and overflowed,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
They lowered him down as a king,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
For his age he is wise,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
My arms and legs were broken,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I had so much left to do,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
I want you so bad,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Now, won't you tell me true,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Don't ever try to change me,
Says he's got a bad cough,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
God knows it's true,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
I think we better talk this over,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Stone you and say good luck,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Cares not to come up any higher,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
A dream about you, baby,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
But I know that he don't talk,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Father of air and father of trees,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Who could they get to carry you,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Don't let her know,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
That the laws are with him,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
And she aches just like a woman,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
To be on your own,
I'm pledging my time to you,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Ten thousand men on the move,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
In the instant that I preach,
Oh, watered-down love,
And I'm just like that bird,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
It still ain't me, babe,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
That one doctor cannot save him,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
This world is ruled by violence,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
And the point is slick,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
People talk of situations,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Without your sweet love,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
A man named Martin Luther King,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
And I––I walk out on my own,
So unknown,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
If I didn't have to guess,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Since you've been gone,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Well, I may just swear,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
We'll go someplace unknown,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Going,
A question in your nerves is lit,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
She'll be coming forth,
While riding on a train going west,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Memory, ecstasy,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
And come every time you call,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Stripping away at it all,
If ever I prove false to you,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
And comes to a permanent stop,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
That her father was going to hang,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Each one playing a horn,
God knows how to make it flow,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
The beat is pumping,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
It always has hit me from below,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
He's the property of Jesus,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
You'll be doing society a favor,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
In the lonely night,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
I want you,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Giving back all of what you owe,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
A thousand miles from home,
In the turning of twilight,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Strike another match, go start anew,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Watching the river flow,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Four by four, no illusion for,
God don't call it wrong,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I want my arms around you,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
To find out if she's talked,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
China doll, alcohol,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
For the wise men and the fools,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
God knows it's a crime,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
And I'm back in the rain,
Going, going, gone,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Don't matter what you did,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Over your senses you have no control,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
But, if I will save you the time,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Winter would have no spring,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
By losers, cheaters,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Or have done something wrong,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
To shine in through,
And on the highway of regret,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
And point away from the past,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I would not feel so all alone,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
How he died nobody could say,
But it ain't him to blame,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Forever young, forever young,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
That fired the gun,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
I love you, pretty baby,
Don't know what to do without it,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Well, I been gambling so long,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Relationships of ownership,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I got two white horses following me,
Better jump down the manhole,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
I can finish this alone, honey,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Socialism, hypnotism,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
One by one they followed the sun,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
People carry roses,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Going home,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
You had enough of hatred,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Go melt back in the night,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Eh, singing just for you,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
She's opened up a happy home,
And you take just like a woman,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
She would have married me,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
The man in the trench-coat,
My limbs are shaking,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
You better duck down the alleyway,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Like a complete unknown,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
So glad,
You have explained every mystery,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
And it's like I ain't here,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
And the whole world is on your case,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
It's rising up above my head,
Broken idols, broken heads,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Try to be a success,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
That they do not respect in any degree,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Someone to close his heart,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Eh, see what you can do,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
I'd only have to stay,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Just don't know what to do,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Well, there ain't no going back,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Tell her not to worry,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
And she'll be coming forth,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
If you'd see me this a-way,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
And your streets are getting empty,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I'm never, never far from home,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
But I'm saved,
I went into the city, into the town,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
And every cause that ever I fought,
To gather flowers constantly,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
May you stay forever young,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
You can run down to the desert,
Said I'm pressing on,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Most of the time it's well understood,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Out to the windy beach,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Watch the river flow,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
There's always someone who understands,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
In the darkness of my night,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
It's like I ain't here,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Aim well, my little one,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Every moon is so sanctified,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
If you'd see me this way,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
One by one they follow the sun,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I went down where the vultures feed,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
And think they're fooling you,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
And, on their promises of paradise,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Under the microscope,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Father of time and father of dreams,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Yes, I want you so bad,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
I've been around this whole country,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Trouble,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
I bless the day I found you,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
But it would not be new,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
If anything is gonna sell,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
The man there said he loved my sound,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Take the motherless children off the street,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
My hands can't feel to grip,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I'm so glad,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Oh, see what you can do,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
I just keep pressing on,
The midnight rain follows the train,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
By users, cheaters,
I ain't looking to block you up,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Stand up straight and tall,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
To stay closer than any friend,
That foreign sound in your ear,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Thieving in the alley,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
You have given me life to live,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
She once was a true love of mine,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Circled by the circus sands,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
They say every man must need protection,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
You got something I want plenty of,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
It's alright,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Read books and repeat quotations,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
I know I can't win,
Human gods aim for their mark,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Friends with you,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
The light I never knowed,
But something has changed,
If not for you,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Joey, Joey,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Ever since I been a child,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
It was a girl I learned it from,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
The kingdoms of experience,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Ye shall be a-changed,
I can see the turning of the key,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Each time we meet, love,
If you must cling to someone,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
I get my sweet reward,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
You have given everything to me,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
They run a brick and tile company,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Of this I can't say very much,
They pass by so silently,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
You were snow, you were rain,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
My love, she speaks softly,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
How he died nobody can say,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
On the stone that remains,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Searching high, searching low,
Heart of mine, go back home,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
But, if I can save you any time,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
You say my kisses are not like his,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Advertising signs, they con,
It hurts me, too,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
By rivers of blindness,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
The night passed away so quickly,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
He won't do nothing to you,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
But the bottles are done,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I got the worried blues,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Madams light the candles,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Can't find what I need,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Gonna serve somebody,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Poor boy never say die,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Don't let me change my heart,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Up and down the block,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
And you make love just like a woman,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
We've killed each one,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Don't let me drift too far,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
And not going through any great extreme,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
And I don't want to drag you down,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
They keep it all hid,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
He is centuries old,
Going, going,
Simplify you, classify you,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Democracy don't rule the world --
That's where you belong --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
And I want you to be that woman.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
I used to care, but things have changed.
For an instant hand touched hand.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Join the army if you fail.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
You may not see me tomorrow.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
Ever since I seen you there.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Living down Sonora way.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
It hurts me, too.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
She acts like we never met.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
That can win what's never been won.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Oh, yes, they did.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
Close your eyes, close the door.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
For the times, they are a-changing.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
On this new morning with you.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Lord, protect my child.
And every window made of glass.
You know the song in my heart.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
And they gotta cut something.
If you just let me follow you down.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
The hour when the ship comes in.
While my conscience explodes.
I had something to protect.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
But with the country to where you're going.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
Even before you came in the door.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
Or stay all night with thee.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Gonna serve somebody.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Police at your back.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
If you just let me come home with you.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
I froze right to the bone.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Drink up your blood like wine.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Just what he was talking about.
He's only a pawn in their game.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
And your golden loom.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
At the sorority sisters' home.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
In fond memory appear.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
For that's the way I remember her best.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Some speak of the future.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Everybody's having them dreams.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
It was a normal day.
The National Guard stands around the door.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Valentines can't buy her.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
When I paint my masterpiece.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
It only brings me sorrow.
I just can't beg you anymore.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Slowly into autumn.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Unless they're from another world.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
All because his face was brown.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Suffering like a fool.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
But the fighter still remains.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
What's real and what is not.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Soft as music, light as spring.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
He's got his mother's eyes.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Crying out that he was framed.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
It would go up against every rule.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
When he played and we didn't dance.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Baby, please come home.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
If'n you don't know by now.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
I scarcely feel the glow.
Some place so high above the wall.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Is just equality in school.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Gal, you're on my mind.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Look a-the other way.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
To kill with no pain.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Someone to open each and every door.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
With the glory that is to be.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
I stood wondering which way to go.
You want a watered-down love.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Until my dying-day.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
It'll never do, somehow.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Watch the parking meters.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Blood on your saddle.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Last radio is playing.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
I shall be released.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Never been so easy or so slow.
The next day could be your last.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
I couldn't find any.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
That linger in the fireball heat.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
I did not do it knowingly.
The whole night through.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
The sooner you can go.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Looking for a new friend.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
That last night I was with.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Blowing through another no-good town.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
But my heart just won't give in.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
For the saving grace that's over me.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Trying to create a next world war.
While evening slips away.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
I can't hear you anymore.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
For your times, they are a-changing.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
You don't have to worry any more.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
You only got ten.
And disregards the rest.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
What looks like the easy way out.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
And it never seemed strange.
An innocent man in a living hell.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
You can't win with a losing hand.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
While I'm in the hall.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
I'd like to know.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Of every man who put me here.
Baby, baby.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
She's in some foreign land.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
And tapestry of rhyme.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
So the radio didn't work so well.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Go find out something only dead men know.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
"Don't trill no news on me.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
I can't see through it anymore.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Epitome, rigidity.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
And I need you, yeah.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
And he was a friend of mine.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
I gave you all of what I could provide.

You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Mama, you been on my mind.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
You're a big girl all the way.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.

Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
I'm younger than that now.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
In my Cadillac.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
Honey, come and see about me.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Kisses she gave him three.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.

But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Who always was too proud to beg.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
May you stay forever young.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.

He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
And make promises by the hours.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Someone's watching over you.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.

To know which way the wind blows.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Someone I really could care for.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
Mortality, reality.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
If not for you.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
He was never known to make a foolish move.

Where I was born and partly raised.

"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
When I'm alone with you.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.

Your voice was all that I heard.
I'll be your baby tonight.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.

Either one of us could do what we do best.
My baby took my heart from me.
Please let me ride you home.
If you won't come out your window.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
See like me or be like me.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
68, but says he's 24.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
I've seen trouble all my days.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
A lover for your life and nothing more.

I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
Without ideals or violence.

But these to tell what's true.
Walking around with no one else.

Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.

Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Come on, baby.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.

One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.

But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.

Foundationed deep somehow.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
For as long as love will last.
Come on, baby...
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.

At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
He gone north for a while.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.

Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.

And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
In the border-towns of despair.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Our chances really was a million to one.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Baby, two feet from the well.
The light I never knowed.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.

Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
So long, honey babe.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.

Where the miners work almost for nothing.

You got a heart of stone.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
What some people are gonna do for money.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
And I'll go last.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
It's that million dollar bash.
Yes, tell me.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I had so little time to fail.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
That I really did try to get close to you.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
You always got more than enough rope.
In the pale moonlight.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
I don't even know why we come.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
And I'll rock you too.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
And I's left alone with three children.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
And each one I've never seen again.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Sweet lady.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Bid farewell forever.
On the caboose of the train.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Ever since we've been apart.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Take it on down to give me grow.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
And the mailbox is locked.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Hoping you'll come through too.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
And there's no time to think.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Tell me.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
In the palace of the Pope.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Heart of mine.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
I have heard rumors all over town.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Wants to get it paid off.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
Come on, honey.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
And all your raging glory.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
See that my grave is kept clean.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
From my toes up to my ears.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
And you only got ten.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Got ice water in my veins.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
I'm a poet, I know it.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
As the present now will later be past.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
That must be what it's all about.
To be alone with you.
You don't want me, give my money back.
With all these promises you left for me.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Crying out that he been framed.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Remember me to one who lives there.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
I don't care what in the world you do.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Even the softest touch.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
My love, she speaks softly.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Honey, I want you.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
At not getting their money's worth.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
It sure is right on a night like this.
Without this love that we call ours.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Leave no stone unturned.
Four by four they turn it some more.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
And get something quick to eat.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
And rivers that ran through every day.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.

Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
You're on the bottom.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
When my working day's through.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.

Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
They want me for a gambling fight.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I don't know any more than this.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
In the summertime when you were with me.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Father of love and father of rain.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
And it is time for me to slide.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Tried to create a next world war.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Or define you or confine you.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
There's no words that need to be said.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Far down the street we stray.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.

But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Everything inside is made of stone.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Hope you're ready.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.

And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
So, darling, you better come through.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
And that failure's no success at all.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Is gonna be against the law.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Leading me, going home.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Chain you down or bring you down.
That brave and devoted band.

Of two mules, trains, and rain.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
You left me standing out in the cold.
And watch the parking meters.
Funny way to start a picnic.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
All my connections too.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Honey, I never would have come.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
But you're not even sure what it is.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
They seem determined to go all the way.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
My baby told me I would have to go.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Try to avoid the scandals.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Someone who will die for you and more.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
Said it was a bad dream.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
His voice was low with pain.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Come on, darling.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
The hour that the ship comes in.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
And the pearls are from Japan.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Tell me that it isn't true.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Hmm.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
'Cause I don't think about it.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
You can show me a new place to start.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
I's looking around just to see myself.
I'm just average, common too.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
To which a scoundrel clings.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
It always does when you're with me.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
You'll never see me frown.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
And light on your right knee.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
But I ain't got Corrina.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Or put up against the wall.
Greenwich Village.
I hope you're ready.
That I left in the French Quarter.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
You'd better get that in your head.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
But I was raised on the other.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Honey, baby.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
If you throw it all away.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Neighborhood bully.
I know the kinds of things you like.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
But mine was a little different, you see.
"And light on my right knee.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
With gold and silver in her hand.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Girls like birds fly away.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
People bending broken rules.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Put me outta doors.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
And the Santa Fe.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
I just can't do what I done before.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
I just can't see through it anymore.
No kindred or relative nigh.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Madams light the candles.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Down to New Orleans.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Than people who are most content.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Saying wants company.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
That old ship was a-going down.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
They both rode off together.
To anything I might've tried.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Right now I'm having trouble.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
So quickly into autumn.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Turned on my record player.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
That which is not permanent don't last.
But that's what I am paid to do.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
But simply because it's true.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
I just can't keep from crying.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
"Get well, get well," said she.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
To live it you had to explode.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Who says she knows me well.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
And pretend that we never have touched.
I got a bird that sings.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
With your golden loom.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
They got – all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And she had left him to die in there.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
I will only let you down.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
Magic in a magical land.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
At my window with a broken wing.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
And then go on home and have my fun.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Where teardrops fall.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.

I'm not the one you need.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
You can say I didn't give to you.
By that soft and shining sea.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
When my memory is not so short.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
Friends with you.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
It runs both cold and deep.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
And no time to think.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
I'll only let you down.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
I been in this thing too long.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
And I've never been too impressed.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Six by six...
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
The same as my father before him.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
I can walk anytime around the block.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Duality, mortality.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
You can make it too.
Oh, her darling love she found.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
And come away with me.
If it just don't make me hurts.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
There was nobody around.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
And all I see are dark eyes.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
But it was more than I could do.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
It ain't quite the end.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Everything is gonna be alright.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Buildings going up to the sky.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Is tearing up your mind.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Patriotism, materialism.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
I can't use it anymore.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
And the night blows rainy.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
The night will soon be gone.
I know something is changed.
"Don't point your finger at me.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
And your highway's getting filled.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
My mind is breaking.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Wasn't any difference to me.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
When she's better only time'll tell.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
I know you always say that you agree.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
To anything I mighta tried.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
And left me here facing the wall.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
It can't be this way everywhere.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Take me as I am or let me go.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
That set everybody free.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Memories of what used to be.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Thought I was a communist.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Lay dead beside him there.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
But you break just like a little girl.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
And she'll only know he's dead.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
The country doctor rambles.
Most of the time.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
Humility, simplicity.
That's really and truly an American.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Going back where we come from.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
You are on the bottom.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
I don't know.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
Hmm, tell me.
He went down to Oxford Town.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
I would only let you down.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
That number eleven was closing.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
The place that I started from.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Behind a man's brain.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Tangled up in blue.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
I followed the winding stream.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
I said that.
From the little Minnesota town.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
She can't find him anywhere.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Find out something only dead men know.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Hope I don't blow it.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
You got it, baby.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Must be and that is all.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Crumble into one another.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
I'll hold it down for you.
Dollar a day's worth.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
We were the wrong side.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Oh, convey herself away.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Go lightly on the ground.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
I'll remember you.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
I got nothing to go back to now.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Gone as the season she's taken.
With the golden loom.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
I need a shot of love.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
Is what this thing here is for.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
God knows...
So many people I never saw in my life.
I hate bears.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
I want everybody to be free.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
It's just the old American way.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.

Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
But there's one promise, darling:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Man is opposed to fair play:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Yeah, serve somebody:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
His epitaph plain:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:

And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Serve somebody:
Till I come into New York town:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Make promises by the hour;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
So many things that we never will undo;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
All lies and jest;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Had to be held down by big police;
Crumble into one another;
I find complete love;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Some speak of the future;
Everybody that was hanging out;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;

<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>

<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>

<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>

<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
When he's standing in front of you?
How many more without any reward?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can I come home with you?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
What can I give to You?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
What's anybody indebted to him for?

The love that a stranger might receive?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Why and what's the reason for?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
So I can know if I'm really real?
What else can a poor boy do?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Before he can hear people cry?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
How could they let you go?
Across the swooping plain?
Before he can see the sky?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
I seen better times, but who has not?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Poor boy, where you been?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
That too many people have died?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
But who did I see but the one I love?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
And one deserving of affection?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Just what in the world has come over you?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Why would I want to take your life?
How could they ever mistake you?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Before it's washed to the sea?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
To love and follow His direction?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Why must you always try to make me over?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
For all these earthly things?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Where did you hide your halo?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
How many compared to yesterday?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
What would life be?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
How can you say he will haunt you?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Who's gonna let it roll?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Baby, can I come home with you?
How can I live for You?
Who killed Davey Moore?
When did you leave heaven?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
What's wrong with you this time?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Does he change the course of rivers?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Just like a rolling stone?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Across the swamp of time?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Like a rolling stone?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Has anybody seen my love?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Gal, where you been so long?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Are you ready?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Where did you lose your wings?
How many more can they afford?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Too many people have died?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Must everybody bow?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
What do you think about that, my friend?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
How much poison did they inhale?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
And how does it feel?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Are you the same person that was here before?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Can you get back in?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Oh, so why not you and me?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Before they're forever banned?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
How's everything in heaven?
Am I ready?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Who you thought you were talking to?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Baby, can't you tell?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
How does it feel?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Before you call him a man?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Have they missed you?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
What good am I?
Of everything you see?
What can I do for You?
By golly, what more can I say?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Does anyone even try?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Roving gambler, he was very bored
You used––be so proud
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
They took a clean-cut kid
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
So I'll make my stand
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And your trouble is you know it too good
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
We live in a political world
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Either from the mountains of Madrid
I've been walking around
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
I run right home and I went to bed
I still can remember the way that you smiled
I want you, baby, just to understand
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And then you told me later as I apologized
Now, whenever I get up and
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Maybe someday you will understand
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
I thought that it was well-understood
The changes I was going through can't even be used
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Somebody seen him hanging around
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Now you don't act so––so proud
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
I'll always thank the Lord
Now, a very great man once said
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
And into the path you are hurled
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
I live in another world
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Many times I've often prayed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
There ain't nothing in this world
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Things would be different the next time we wed
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
While some, on principles baptized
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
As I stand upon the sand
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
"Equality". I spoke the word
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And those whom doom and death had spared
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
To see him obviously framed
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
She let go of my hand
But she ain't gonna find the road
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Just what you had in mind
Its iron claws attached
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
You try so hard, but you don't understand
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
For what you sold that's not been received
You used to be so amused
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
How many times can a man turn his head
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
But now something has changed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
But something has changed
Silvio, silver and gold
By no special friend
Everything stays down where it's wounded
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
And things would be different the next time we wed
It's something you did
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Now you don't seem so proud
Nothing was delivered
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
All the sweethearts you can hold
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
I had to say something to strike him very weird
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
I will not go down under the ground
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
He was a clean-cut kid
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I do declare
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
As he rises to fame
Should I put them by your gate
And suddenly there appeared before me
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
So, I called up the operator of time
And that is that one must always flush out his house
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Well, it's all new to me
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
But I can't say I sympathize
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
And plenty time for good romance
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Feel to moan, but unlike before
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Taking care of somebody nice
What you're gonna say when you get home
We see this empty cage now corrode
The crashing waves roll over me
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
You know, it's not even safe no more
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
I been wondering all about me
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
I don't even notice she gone
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
You say you're looking for someone
Remember me to one who lives there
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
I rode with him in a taxi once
Remember me to the one who lives there
You said you'd never compromise
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
"It's only you that he does crave
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And I'm just the same as anyone else
From the Golden Gate Bridge
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
So up she picked her babies three
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
And you see why it's so unique to be
I am homeless, come and take me
How was I to know you'd be the one
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
The man the authorities came to blame
And I ain't complaining none
It'll be with me unto the grave
Limited in sex they dare
He'll see by his grave
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Breaking hearts up and down the line
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
You into thinking you're the one
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Where I could watch her waltz for free
I can survive and I can endure
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
To give the special one you seek a chance
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Knows there's no success like failure
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Just what you will say when you get home
But I can get another one
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
To show you something you seen before
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
So I look like a walking mountain range
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
At dawn my lover comes to me
She knows there's no success like failure
On the rising curve
That she's the same one
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
From the start by the rule
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Maybe someday you will look back and see
You cut to the core
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
If dogs run free, then what must be
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Why wait any longer for the one you love
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
All I feel is heat and flame
When the rain is blowing in your face
Little did I realize
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
It's all new to me
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
What good am I then to others and me
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
You're not free to belong to me
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Just pick anyone
Waiting to find out what price
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
You smiling through the fence at me
Should I leave them by your gate
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
What about that millionaire
Mona tried to tell me
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
They say don't come back no more
How many ears must one man have
Con you into thinking that you're the one
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
With all memory and fate
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Though its shadow's metal badge
When I'm all alone
A girl who would murder her own, true love
So I remember every face
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Hunger pays a heavy price
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
But I feel nothing for their game
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And her silver-studded phantom cause
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
When the roses fade
While them that defend what they cannot see
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And I would send a message
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
If dogs run free, why not we
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
But it won't be over till they clear his name
I'm ready for to fade
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
But the dark does die
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Says it's closing time
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
When Reilly's daughter got a message
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Up into some paradise
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Among the lovely people living free
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
She been gone
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
The cause was there before we came
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Lies that life is black-and-white
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
From all the plans they do pursue
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
A bed that is never mine
You just pick anyone
She plunged him into well water where
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
"Oh, father, you will surely die
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
And never sat once at the head of the table
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
There were times when I was so lonesome
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And the Negro's name
If dogs run free, why not me
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Full of hope and desire
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
What's probably got you baffled more
Better stay away from those
Trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
She rode by night and came by morning
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Where the time and the tempo drag
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
For your weary toes to be a-touching
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
The order is a-rapidly fading
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
I can hear their hearts a-beating
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
You left me standing in the doorway crying
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
For your weary toes to be touching
There's nothing in here moving
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Beyond here lies nothing
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
They're drinking up and walking
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
If I was with her too long
Deceived me into thinking
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
What am I saying? What am I knowing
The battle outside raging
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
But then a whistle will be blowing
'Cause the battle outside raging
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
It's not a bad way to make a living
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
The order is rapidly fading
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Then she told us how times were tough
And how I know I'll make it through
You go north and you go south
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Look out, the saints are coming through
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I have fallen far beneath
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
The man in me will do nearly any task
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Well, there ain't no going back
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Shoot in the back
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
But they caught him and they brought him back
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
I wish she'd unlock
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Her voice once and talk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
You turn around to take a final peek
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
How many seas must the white dove sail
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
They ask me how I feel
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
A-how does it feel
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Ring bar, hard to tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
But among the dead that were left on the hill
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And if my love is real
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Muttering small talk at the wall
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Ring bell, hard to tell
How does it feel
He's sure got a lot of gall
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Then why don't she tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
I chased me a woman up the hill
Soul to soul our shadows roll
All and all can only fall
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Oh, how does it feel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
How many seas must a white dove sail
A girl by the whirlpool
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Well, if I die on top of the hill
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
He's taught in his school
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Two eyes took the aim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
"For you cannot relive them
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And remain as I am
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You better not chew gum
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
But I can hear another drum
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
In the pigpen
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Have died in battle or in vain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
As they rode him in custody down to the station
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Well, I'm hanging on
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
For the loser now will be later to win
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
How can the life of such a man
And there's no exit in any direction
Must meet the dawn
And all their daughters put me down
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Nothing we can call our own
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Trying to get a lead on
I'll be waiting at the station
And the smell of their roses does not remain
"Not me," said the gambling man
That long, black train is pulling down
Why did you trade heaven
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Out of the shower comes a football man
Advertising signs that con
And the corner sign
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
I figure maybe we're even
Guns and clubs followed him down
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
But the post office has been stolen
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
She takes just like a woman
Will not be understood as they're spoken
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Yet I swear I see my reflection
To remember the times when I was your only man
That long, black train is pulling on down
But the second mother was with the seventh son
The ones that jump on the wagon
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
To my knowledge there's just one man
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
A-she takes just like a woman
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
You take just like a woman
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
And she aches just like a woman
And she wakes just like a woman
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
You don't need a weatherman
You need something to make it known
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
For the loser now might be later to win
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Their religion of the little ten women
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Darkness at the break of noon
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
But all their daughters put me down
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
My love, she's like some raven
But it's hard to think on
And you ache a-just like a woman
Somebody new to beat on
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
She said that all the railroad men
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
From heights that they could not gain
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
He got that fortress on the mountain
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I don't even care if I ever see her again
But the second mom was with the seventh son
How many roads must a man walk down
As you sit on the box you keep him in
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
All their daughters put me down
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
She got such a sweet disposition
Suicide remarks are torn
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
The next morning she had awoken
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
But me, I expected it to happen
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
But I swear I see my reflection
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Yes, and someone must explain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Well, you fake just like a woman
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
All I really wanna do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
All I'd like you to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
There's nothing you can say or do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Every place I wanna go
Silvio, I gotta go
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Man in the coon-skin cap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
How many times must a man look up
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
I walked down there and ended up
Aladdin and his lamp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
What good am I while you softly weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Never no more do I wonder
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Still I've always kind of missed her
In one I was running and in another
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When only you are near
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
All you boys better run for cover
For all eternity I think I will remember
The face of God will appear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
But morning is clear
I say, "Why you say that for
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
So, don't fear if you hear
At any moment you could go under
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The wind howls like a hammer
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I close my eyes and I wonder
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
And I don't even think about her
I don't have to go far
For I am married to a house carpenter
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
You heard me saying a prayer for
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
She took him by his long, yellow hair
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
When you whispered in my ear
The lover who has just walked out your door
I could feel a whole lot better
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
My ship is in the harbor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
Still I say her love-words over
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Who came here from Cuba's door
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
You know that he has no intentions
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I try to tell it like it is
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And so Patty calls the cops
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
As friends and other strangers
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
To sharpen the senses
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
But still remains
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Glide across the lonely years
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
But, though the masters make the rules
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
The empty-handed painter from your streets
People carry roses
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
You been hurt so many times
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
What good am I if I say foolish things
That it's you and no one else that owns
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
People on the platforms
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And inside it with the people made of molasses
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Don't wear sandals
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
And the princess and the prince discuss
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
To the cutting of fences
Thinking of a series of dreams
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You never turned around to see the frowns
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
To memorizing politics
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
True love can make a blade of grass
I let it slip gladly to my friends
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
He's not selling any alibis
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And, though the masters make the rules
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
"Not me," said the man whose fists
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And then complains
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
And I try to harmonize with songs
And your father, to your sister he explains
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
I'd gladly confess
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Statues made of matchsticks
And tells me of her dreams
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Six-time users
They whisper in the wings
Good and bad, I define these terms
And the poor white remains
Romantic facts of musketeers
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Now, you must provide some answers
With a big bouquet of the roses
Six-time losers
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
At times I think there are no words
Girl by the whirlpool's
I'm gonna let you pass
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Wants eleven dollar bills
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Seven days
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
The cowboy angel rides
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Her window's wide open, African trees
Don't follow leaders
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
You can fall down on your knees
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Well, the ragman draws circles
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
When your mother sends back all your invitations
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
You should be made to wear earphones
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
We living in times when men commit crimes
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Mama, you know, awaits the news
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
On the back of the fish truck that loads
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Every new messenger bringing evil report
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Without any doubt
You don't forget
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
We can hold up a toast if we meet
To hold each other tight
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Keep me set apart
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Well, I finally started thinking straight
He built a fire on Main Street
Everything is always right
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
That might be all that you got
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
You used to laugh about
I got into the driver's seat
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
They tell me revenge is sweet
Wait for the morning light
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
How many years can a mountain exist
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
I think that it's best
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
There's some people that
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
They tell me to be discreet
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
And I, in my armor, turning about
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
I'm moving after midnight
One more night I will wait for the light
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
It don't take too long to find out
Our Father would not like the way that you act
In the precious winds they rot
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Yet you know there is no answer fit
The slow one now will later be fast
Everyone still talks about
She seems too far out
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Well, early in the morning till late at night
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
One more night the moon is shining bright
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
In the stillness of the midnight
You're gonna get hit
Talking that the heat put
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Ain't it hard when you discover that
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
But, if the arrow is straight
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
You're hearing my heart beat
With your pockets well protected at last
By the way, that's a cute hat
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Oh, everybody's got to eat
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Like a corkscrew to my heart
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
I soon get some rest
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I'm on the pavement
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
How many years can some people exist
So he never thinks straight
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
He really wasn't where it's at
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Plants in the bed, but
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Johnny's in the basement
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
The slowest now will later be fast
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
You used to laugh–make fun about
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
And the first one now will later be last
You are there in the flickering light
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And, since my feet are now fast
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To protect you and defend you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I'll remember you
To be alone with you
It's just crazy being here with you
I can be just like you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
And I tell this truth to you
I just might have to come see you
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Well, I'd sure like to know
Down every street there's a window
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
He been living there three years now
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
It only goes to show
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
But sooner or later one of us must know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Sooner or later one of us must know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
The only one I know
I'd sure like to know
Don't it always a-go to show
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
With only you in view
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Don't it always go to show
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
For them that think death's honesty
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Or if you just want some company
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
The Spanish-American War had its day
My ears hear a symphony
From phony jealousy
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
For them that must obey authority
And that which you've given me today
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
She puts it to me plain as day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Maggie says that many say
My mind weaves a symphony
Is worth more than I could pay
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Someone to get you flowers constantly
No, you'll not now or no other day
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
If I don't take the chance to try
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
I send you all my money
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Went to the doctor the very next day
And for His love they took His life away
But you can never steal away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
So they took him to the infirmary
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
So, I'm walking down your highway
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
And the only tune my guitar could play
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
We banged the drum slowly
She smiles, walks the other way
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Spouted out that liberty
Though I'd never say
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
But I wish there was something you would do or say
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
And the ladies treat me kindly
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
To those condemned to act accordingly
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
So I run down most hurriedly
For them that think death––death's honesty
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
That I was just a puppet in a play
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
But I can't deny
I did not do it harmfully
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
How many times must the cannon balls fly
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
That I done it the way
The same thing I would want today
And it's up to you to say
She knocked upon it anyway
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Don't you tell Henry
A cock is crowing far away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Ha–va–
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Leave all the children home –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
How badly they were shocked –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Indians camp along her border –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
I ask you how things could get much worse –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Hang out the whole next day –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
To know where you are –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
You will not hear a laugh –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Whispering your secret emotion –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Private reasons – great or small –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Remember me to one who lives there –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
I got no idea what I want –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
That can win what's a-never been won –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
First degree and second degree –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Havanagee–luh–
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Disconnect these cables––
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
It can't be this way everywhere –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
I hope that you can hear––
I'm sure it was not three –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Hava–na–
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Havana–gee–
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Judge had the papers in his hand –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
I a-hope you can hear––
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Oh, my–
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
As suicide remarks are torn –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Ten thousand miles or more –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
I long to hold you in the night –
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
